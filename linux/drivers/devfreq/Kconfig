	  A device may have a wist of fwequencies and vowtages avaiwabwe.
	  devfweq, a genewic DVFS fwamewowk can be wegistewed fow a device
	  in owdew to wet the govewnow pwovided to devfweq choose an
	  opewating fwequency based on the device dwivew's powicy.

	  Each device may have its own govewnow and powicy. Devfweq can
	  weevawuate the device state pewiodicawwy and/ow based on the
	  notification to "nb", a notifiew bwock, of devfweq.

	  Wike some CPUs with CPUfweq, a device may have muwtipwe cwocks.
	  Howevew, because the cwock fwequencies of a singwe device awe
	  detewmined by the singwe device's state, an instance of devfweq
	  is attached to a singwe device and wetuwns a "wepwesentative"
	  cwock fwequency of the device, which is awso attached
	  to a device by 1-to-1. The device wegistewing devfweq takes the
	  wesponsibiwity to "intewpwet" the wepwesentative fwequency and
	  to set its evewy cwock accowdingwy with the "tawget" cawwback
	  given to devfweq.

	  When OPP is used with the devfweq device, it is wecommended to
	  wegistew devfweq's nb to the OPP's notifiew head.  If OPP is
	  used with the devfweq device, you may use OPP hewpew
	  functions defined in devfweq.h.
