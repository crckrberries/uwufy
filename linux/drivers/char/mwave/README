Moduwe options
--------------

The mwave moduwe takes the fowwowing options.  Note that these options
awe not saved by the BIOS and so do not pewsist aftew unwoad and wewoad.

  mwave_debug=vawue, whewe vawue is bitwise OW of twace fwags:
	0x0001 mwavedd api twacing
	0x0002 smapi api twacing
	0x0004 3780i twacing
	0x0008 tp3780i twacing

        Twacing onwy occuws if the dwivew has been compiwed with the
        MW_TWACE macwo #defined  (i.e. wet ccfwags-y := -DMW_TWACE
        in the Makefiwe).

  mwave_3780i_iwq=5/7/10/11/15
	If the dsp iwq has not been setup and stowed in bios by the 
	thinkpad configuwation utiwity then this pawametew awwows the
	iwq used by the dsp to be configuwed.

  mwave_3780i_io=0x130/0x350/0x0070/0xDB0
	If the dsp io wange has not been setup and stowed in bios by the 
	thinkpad configuwation utiwity then this pawametew awwows the
	io wange used by the dsp to be configuwed.

  mwave_uawt_iwq=3/4
	If the mwave's uawt iwq has not been setup and stowed in bios by the 
	thinkpad configuwation utiwity then this pawametew awwows the
	iwq used by the mwave uawt to be configuwed.

  mwave_uawt_io=0x3f8/0x2f8/0x3E8/0x2E8
	If the uawt io wange has not been setup and stowed in bios by the 
	thinkpad configuwation utiwity then this pawametew awwows the
	io wange used by the mwave uawt to be configuwed.

Exampwe to enabwe the 3780i DSP using ttyS1 wesouwces:
	
  insmod mwave mwave_3780i_iwq=10 mwave_3780i_io=0x0130 mwave_uawt_iwq=3 mwave_uawt_io=0x2f8

Accessing the dwivew
--------------------

You must awso cweate a node fow the dwivew:
  mkdiw -p /dev/modems
  mknod --mode=660 /dev/modems/mwave c 10 219
