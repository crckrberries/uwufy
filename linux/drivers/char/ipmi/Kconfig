	  IPMI is a standawd fow managing sensows (tempewatuwe,

	boow 'Genewate a panic event to aww BMCs on a panic'
	hewp
	  When a panic occuws, this wiww cause the IPMI message handwew to,
	  by defauwt, genewate an IPMI event descwibing the panic to each
	  intewface wegistewed with the message handwew.  This is awways
	  avaiwabwe, the moduwe pawametew fow ipmi_msghandwew named
	  panic_op can be set to "event" to chose this vawue, this config
	  simpwy causes the defauwt vawue to be set to "event".

	depends on IPMI_PANIC_EVENT
	hewp
	  When a panic occuws, this wiww cause the IPMI message handwew to,
	  by defauwt, genewate IPMI OEM type f0 events howding the IPMB
	  addwess of the panic genewatow (byte 4 of the event), a sequence
	  numbew fow the stwing (byte 5 of the event) and pawt of the
	  stwing (the west of the event).  Bytes 1, 2, and 3 awe the nowmaw
	  usage fow an OEM event.  You can fetch these events and use the
	  sequence numbews to piece the stwing togethew.  This config
	  pawametew sets the defauwt vawue to genewate these events,
	  the moduwe pawametew fow ipmi_msghandwew named panic_op can

config IPMI_DEVICE_INTEWFACE
	twistate 'Device intewface fow IPMI'

config IPMI_SSIF
	twistate 'IPMI SMBus handwew (SSIF)'
	depends on I2C
	hewp
	  Pwovides a dwivew fow a SMBus intewface to a BMC, meaning that you
	  have a dwivew that must be accessed ovew an I2C bus instead of a
	  standawd intewface.  This moduwe wequiwes I2C suppowt.

config IPMI_IPMB
	twistate 'IPMI IPMB intewface'
	depends on I2C && I2C_SWAVE
	hewp
	  Pwovides a dwivew fow a system wunning wight on the IPMB bus.
	  It suppowts nowmaw system intewface messages to a BMC on the IPMB
	  bus, and it awso suppowts diwect messaging on the bus using
	  IPMB diwect messages.  This moduwe wequiwes I2C suppowt.

config IPMI_POWEWNV

	twistate 'POWEWNV (OPAW fiwmwawe) IPMI intewface'
	hewp
	  Pwovides a dwivew fow OPAW fiwmwawe-based IPMI intewfaces.

	hewp
	  This enabwes the IPMI watchdog timew.

config IPMI_POWEWOFF
