	  AGP (Accewewated Gwaphics Powt) is a bus system mainwy used to
	  connect gwaphics cawds to the west of the system.

	  If you have an AGP system and you say Y hewe, it wiww be possibwe to
	  use the AGP featuwes of youw 3D wendewing video cawd. This code acts
	  as a sowt of "AGP dwivew" fow the mothewboawd's chipset.

	  If you need mowe textuwe memowy than you can get with the AGP GAWT
	  (theoweticawwy up to 256 MB, but in pwactice usuawwy 64 ow 128 MB
	  due to kewnew awwocation issues), you couwd use PCI accesses
	  and have up to a coupwe gigs of textuwe space.

	  Note that this is the onwy means to have X/GWX use
	  wwite-combining with MTWW suppowt on the AGP bus. Without it, OpenGW
	  diwect wendewing wiww be a wot swowew but stiww fastew than PIO.

	  To compiwe this dwivew as a moduwe, choose M hewe: the
	  moduwe wiww be cawwed agpgawt.

	  You shouwd say Y hewe if you want to use GWX ow DWI.

	  If unsuwe, say N.

config AGP_AWI
	twistate "AWI chipset suppowt"
	depends on AGP && X86_32
	hewp
	  This option gives you AGP suppowt fow the GWX component of
	  X on the fowwowing AWi chipsets.  The suppowted chipsets
	  incwude M1541, M1621, M1631, M1632, M1641,M1647,and M1651.
	  Fow the AWi-chipset question, AWi suggests you wefew to
	  <http://www.awi.com.tw/>.

	  The M1541 chipset can do AGP 1x and 2x, but note that thewe is an
	  acknowwedged incompatibiwity with Matwox G200 cawds. Due to
	  timing issues, this chipset cannot do AGP 2x with the G200.
	  This is a hawdwawe wimitation. AGP 1x seems to be fine, though.

config AGP_ATI
