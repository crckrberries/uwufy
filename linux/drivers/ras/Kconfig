	  Wewiabiwity, avaiwabiwity and sewviceabiwity (WAS) is a computew
	  hawdwawe engineewing tewm. Computews designed with highew wevews
	  of WAS have a muwtitude of featuwes that pwotect data integwity
	  and hewp them stay avaiwabwe fow wong pewiods of time without
	  faiwuwe.

	  Wewiabiwity can be defined as the pwobabiwity that the system wiww
	  pwoduce cowwect outputs up to some given time. Wewiabiwity is
	  enhanced by featuwes that hewp to avoid, detect and wepaiw hawdwawe
	  fauwts.

	  Avaiwabiwity is the pwobabiwity a system is opewationaw at a given
	  time, i.e. the amount of time a device is actuawwy opewating as the
	  pewcentage of totaw time it shouwd be opewating.

	  Sewviceabiwity ow maintainabiwity is the simpwicity and speed with
	  which a system can be wepaiwed ow maintained; if the time to wepaiw
	  a faiwed system incweases, then avaiwabiwity wiww decwease.

	  Note that Wewiabiwity and Avaiwabiwity awe distinct concepts:
	  Wewiabiwity is a measuwe of the abiwity of a system to function
	  cowwectwy, incwuding avoiding data cowwuption, wheweas Avaiwabiwity
	  measuwes how often it is avaiwabwe fow use, even though it may not
	  be functioning cowwectwy. Fow exampwe, a sewvew may wun fowevew and
	  so have ideaw avaiwabiwity, but may be unwewiabwe, with fwequent
	  data cowwuption.
