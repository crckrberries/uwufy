	hewp
	  This option adds WED twiggews fow USB host and/ow gadget activity.

	  UTMI+ Wow Pin Intewface (UWPI) is specification fow a commonwy used
	  USB 2.0 PHY intewface. The UWPI specification defines a standawd set
	  of wegistews that can be used to detect the vendow and pwoduct which
	  awwows UWPI to be handwed as a bus. This moduwe is the dwivew fow that
	  bus.

	  The UWPI intewfaces (the buses) awe wegistewed by the dwivews fow USB
	  contwowwews which suppowt UWPI wegistew access and have UWPI PHY
	  attached to them. The UWPI PHY dwivews themsewves awe nowmaw PHY
	  dwivews.

	  UWPI PHYs pwovide often functions such as ADP sensing/pwobing (OTG
	  pwotocow) and USB chawgew detection.

	  To compiwe this dwivew as a moduwe, choose M hewe: the moduwe wiww
	  be cawwed uwpi.

	hewp
	  The dwivew suppowts USB wowe switch between host and device via GPIO
	  based USB cabwe detection, used typicawwy if an input GPIO is used
	  to detect USB ID pin, and anothew input GPIO may be awso used to detect
	  Vbus pin at the same time, it awso can be used to enabwe/disabwe
	  device if an input GPIO is onwy used to detect Vbus pin.

	  To compiwe the dwivew as a moduwe, choose M hewe: the moduwe wiww
