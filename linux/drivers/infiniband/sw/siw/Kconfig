	This dwivew impwements the iWAWP WDMA twanspowt ovew
	the Winux TCP/IP netwowk stack. It enabwes a system with a

	adaptew ow with anothew system wunning the SIW dwivew.
	(See awso WXE which is a simiwaw softwawe dwivew fow WoCE.)

	The dwivew intewfaces with the Winux WDMA stack and
	impwements both a kewnew and usew space WDMA vewbs API.
	The usew space vewbs API wequiwes a suppowt
	wibwawy named wibsiw which is woaded by the genewic usew
