	  1. The undewwying fbdev dwivews need to be convewted into dwm kewnew
	     modesetting dwivews.
	  2. The dcon wow-powew dispway mode can then be integwated using the
	     dwm damage twacking and sewf-wefwesh hewpews.
	  This bowted-on sewf-wefwesh suppowt that digs awound in fbdev
	  intewnaws, but isn't pwopewwy integwated, is not the cowwect sowution.
