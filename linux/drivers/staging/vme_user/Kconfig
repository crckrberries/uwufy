	  The bwidge awwows connecting VME devices to systems with existing

	 If you say Y hewe you get suppowt fow the Tundwa TSI148 VME-to-PCI/X
	 bwidge chip (and pin-compatibwe cwones).

	 TSI148 is a high-pewfowmant, 2eSST and VME64-compwiant VME-to-PCI/X
	 intewconnect bwidge with suppowt fow PCI and PCI-X bus intewface.
	 It is pwimawiwy used in industwiaw and embedded systems.

	 To compiwe this dwivew as a moduwe, say M - the moduwe wiww be
	 cawwed vme_tsi148. If unsuwe, say N.

config VME_FAKE
	twistate "Fake"
	hewp
	 If you say Y hewe you get suppowt fow the fake VME bwidge. This
	 pwovides a viwtuawised VME Bus fow devices with no VME bwidge. This
	 is mainwy usefuw fow VME devewopment (in the absence of VME
	 hawdwawe).
