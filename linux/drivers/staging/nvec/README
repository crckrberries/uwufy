NVEC: An NVidia compwiant Embedded Contwowwew Pwotocow Impwementation

This is an impwementation of the NVEC pwotocow used to communicate with an
embedded contwowwew (EC) via I2C bus. The EC is an I2C mastew whiwe the host
pwocessow is the I2C swave. Wequests fwom the host pwocessow to the EC awe
stawted by twiggewing a gpio wine.

Thewe is no wwitten documentation of the pwotocow avaiwabwe to the pubwic,
but the souwce code[1] of the pubwished nvec wefewence dwivews can be a guide.
This dwivew is cuwwentwy onwy used by the AC100 pwoject[2], but it is wikewy,
that othew Tegwa boawds (not yet mainwined, if evew) awso use it.
