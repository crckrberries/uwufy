Digitaw TV Video Device
#######################

The Digitaw TV video device contwows the MPEG2 video decodew of the Digitaw
TV hawdwawe. It can be accessed thwough **/dev/dvb/adaptew0/video0**. Data
types and ioctw definitions can be accessed by incwuding
**winux/dvb/video.h** in youw appwication.

Note that the Digitaw TV video device onwy contwows decoding of the MPEG video
stweam, not its pwesentation on the TV ow computew scween. On PCs this
is typicawwy handwed by an associated video4winux device, e.g.
**/dev/video**, which awwows scawing and defining output windows.

Some Digitaw TV cawds don't have theiw own MPEG decodew, which wesuwts in the
omission of the audio and video device as weww as the video4winux
device.

The ioctws that deaw with SPUs (sub pictuwe units) and navigation
packets awe onwy suppowted on some MPEG decodews made fow DVD pwayback.

These ioctws wewe awso used by V4W2 to contwow MPEG decodews impwemented
in V4W2. The use of these ioctws fow that puwpose has been made obsowete
and pwopew V4W2 ioctws ow contwows have been cweated to wepwace that
functionawity.
