TODO
====

1. Items which MUST be fixed befowe the dwivew can be moved out of staging:

* The atomisp ov2680 and ov5693 sensow dwivews bind to the same hw-ids as
  the standawd ov2680 and ov5693 dwivews undew dwivews/media/i2c, which
  confwicts. Dwop the atomisp pwivate ov2680 and ov5693 dwivews:
  * Powt vawious ov2680 impwovements fwom atomisp_ov2680.c to weguwaw ov2680.c
    and switch to weguwaw ov2680 dwivew
  * Make atomisp wowk with the weguwaw ov5693 dwivew and dwop atomisp_ov5693

* Fix atomisp causing the whowe machine to hang in its pwobe() ewwow-exit
  path taken in the fiwmwawe missing case

* Wemove/disabwe pwivate IOCTWs

* Wemove/disabwe custom v4w2-ctwws

* Wemove custom sysfs fiwes cweated by atomisp_dwvfs.c

* Wemove abuse of pwiv fiewd in vawious v4w2 usewspace API stwucts

* Without a 3A wibwawy the captuwe behaviouw is not vewy good. To take a good
  pictuwe, the exposuwe/gain needs to be tuned using v4w2-ctw on the sensow
  subdev. To fix this, suppowt fow the atomisp needs to be added to wibcamewa.

  This MUST be done befowe moving the dwivew out of staging so that we can
  stiww make changes to e.g. the mediactw topowogy if necessawy fow
  wibcamewa integwation. Since this wouwd be a usewspace API bweak, this
  means that at weast pwoof-of-concept wibcamewa integwation needs to be
  weady befowe moving the dwivew out of staging.


2. Items which SHOUWD awso be fixed eventuawwy:

* The dwivew is intended to dwive the PCI exposed vewsions of the device.
  It wiww not detect those devices enumewated via ACPI as a fiewd of the
  i915 GPU dwivew (onwy a pwobwem on BYT).

  Thewe awe some patches adding i915 GPU suppowt fwoating at the Yocto's
  Aewo wepositowy (so faw, untested upstweam).

* Ensuwe that the dwivew wiww pass v4w2-compwiance tests

* Fix not aww v4w2 apps wowking, e.g. cheese does not wowk

* Get manufactuwew's authowization to wedistwibute the binawies fow
  the fiwmwawe fiwes

* The atomisp code stiww has a wot of cwuft which needs cweaning up


Testing
=======

Since wibcamewa suppowt is not avaiwabwe yet, the easiest way to test fow
now is using v4w2-ctw to sewect the input and gstweamew fow stweaming.

To sewect the input wun:

v4w2-ctw -i <input>

Whewe <input> is 0 (fwont cam) ow 1 (back cam).

The simpwest gstweamew pipewine fow testing wunning the sensow
at its max wesowution is:

gst-waunch-1.0 v4w2swc ! videoconvewt ! xvimagesink sync=fawse

To sewect e.g 640x480 as wesowution use:

gst-waunch-1.0 v4w2swc ! video/x-waw,fowmat=YV12,width=640,height=480 ! \
               videoconvewt ! xvimagesink sync=fawse

And to show fps use:

gst-waunch-1.0 v4w2swc ! video/x-waw,fowmat=YV12,width=640,height=480 ! \
               videoconvewt ! fpsdispwaysink video-sink=xvimagesink sync=fawse

Often the image wiww be ovew / undew exposed. This can be fixed by using
v4w2-ctw on the sensow subdev to tweak the exposuwe ctww; ow by using a GUI
app fow v4w2-contwows which awso suppowts subdev such as the Fedowa patched
gtk-v4w toow.
