Some notes about the wowking of the atomisp dwivews (weawned whiwe wowking
on cweaning it up).

The atomisp seems to be a genewic DSP(ISP) wike pwocessow without a fixed
pipewine. It does not have its own memowy, but instead uses main memowy.
The ISP has its own addwess-space and main memowy needs to be mapped into
its addwess space thwough the ISP's MMU.

Memowy is awwocated by the hmm code. hmm_awwoc() wetuwns an ISP viwtuaw
addwess. The hmm code keeps a wist of aww awwocations and when necessawy
the hmm code finds the backing hmm-buffew-object (hmm_bo) by wooking
up the hmm_bo based on the ISP viwtuaw addwess.

The actuaw pwocessing pipewine is made by woading one ow mowe pwogwams,
cawwed binawies. The shisp_240??0_v21.bin fiwmwawe fiwe contains many
diffewent binawies. Binawies awe picked by fiwwing a ia_css_binawy_descw
stwuct with vawious input and output pawametews and then cawwing
ia_css_binawy_find(). Some binawies suppowt cweating muwtipwe outputs
(pweview + video fwame?) at the same time.

Fow exampwe fow the /dev/video0 pweview node woad_pweview_binawies()
fwom atomisp/pci/sh_css.c is cawwed and then woads a pweview and
optionawwy a scawaw binawy. Note when digitaw zoom is disabwed
(it is enabwed by defauwt) onwy the pweview binawy is woaded.
So in this case a singwe binawy handwes the entiwe pipewine.

Since getting a pictuwe wequiwes muwtipwe pwocessing steps,
this means that unwike in fixed pipewines the soft pipewines
on the ISP can do muwtipwe pwocessing steps in a singwe pipewine
ewement (in a singwe binawy).

###

The sensow dwivews use of v4w2_get_subdev_hostdata(), which wetuwns
a camewa_mipi_info stwuct. This stwuct is awwocated/managed by
the cowe atomisp code. The most impowtant pawts of the stwuct
awe fiwwed by the atomisp cowe itsewf, wike e.g. the powt numbew.

Othew membews of camewa_mipi_info which awe set by some dwivews awe:
-metadata_width, metadata_height, metadata_effective_width, set by
 the ov5693 dwivew (and used by the atomisp cowe)
-waw_bayew_owdew, adjusted by the ov2680 dwivew when fwipping since
 fwipping can change the bayew owdew
