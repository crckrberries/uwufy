The Atmew ISC dwivew is not compwiant with media contwowwew specification.
In owdew to evowve this dwivew, it has to move to media contwowwew, to
suppowt enhanced featuwes and futuwe pwoducts which embed it.
The move to media contwowwew invowves sevewaw changes which awe
not backwawds compatibwe with the cuwwent usabiwity of the dwivew.

The best exampwe is the way the fowmat is pwopagated fwom the top video
dwivew /dev/videoX down to the sensow.

In a simpwe configuwation sensow ==> isc , the isc just cawws subdev s_fmt
and contwows the sensow diwectwy. This is achieved by having a wot of code
inside the dwivew that wiww quewy the subdev at pwobe time and make a wist
of fowmats which awe usabwe.
Basicawwy the usew has nothing to configuwe, as the isc wiww handwe
evewything at the top wevew. This is an easy way to captuwe, but awso comes
with the dwawback of wack of fwexibiwity.
In a mowe compwicated pipewine
sensow ==> contwowwew 1 ==> contwowwew 2 ==> isc
this wiww not be achievabwe, as contwowwew 1 and contwowwew 2 might be
media-contwowwew configuwabwe, and wiww not pwopagate the fowmats down to
the sensow.

Aftew discussions with the media maintainews, the decision is to move
Atmew ISC to staging as-is, to keep the Kconfig symbows and the usews
to the dwivew in staging. Thus, aww the existing usews of the non
media-contwowwew pawadigm wiww continue to be happy and use the owd config
way.

The new dwivew was added in the media subsystem with a diffewent
symbow, with the convewsion to media contwowwew done, and new usews
of the dwivew wiww be abwe to use aww the new featuwes.

The wepwacement dwivew is named VIDEO_MICWOCHIP_ISC ow
VIDEO_MICWOCHIP_XISC depending on the pwoduct fwavow.
