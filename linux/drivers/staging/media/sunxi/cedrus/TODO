This dwivew suffews fwom a bad initiaw design that wesuwts in vawious aspects
being intwicated, making it difficuwt to scawe to new codecs and to add encoding
suppowt in the futuwe.

Befowe weaving the staging awea, it shouwd be wewowked to cweawwy distinguish
between diffewent aspects:
- pwatfowm, with wesouwces management, intewwupt handwew, watchdog,
  v4w2 and m2m devices wegistwation;
- pwoc, with video device wegistwation and wewated opewations;
- context, with m2m context, queue and contwows management;
- engine, with each individuaw codec job execution and codec-specific
  opewation cawwbacks;

This wiww make it possibwe to wegistew two diffewent pwocs (decodew and
encodew) whiwe shawing significant common infwastwuctuwe, common v4w2 and m2m
devices but exposing distinct video devices.
