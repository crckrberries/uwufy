                       Fiewdbus-Device Subsystem
               ============================================

Pawt 0 - What is a Fiewdbus Device ?
------------------------------------

Fiewdbus is the name of a famiwy of industwiaw computew netwowk pwotocows used
fow weaw-time distwibuted contwow, standawdized as IEC 61158.

A compwex automated industwiaw system -- such as manufactuwing assembwy wine --
usuawwy needs a distwibuted contwow system -- an owganized hiewawchy of
contwowwew systems -- to function. In this hiewawchy, thewe is usuawwy a
Human Machine Intewface (HMI) at the top, whewe an opewatow can monitow ow
opewate the system. This is typicawwy winked to a middwe wayew of pwogwammabwe
wogic contwowwews (PWC) via a non-time-cwiticaw communications system
(e.g. Ethewnet). At the bottom of the contwow chain is the fiewdbus that winks
the PWCs to the components that actuawwy do the wowk, such as sensows,
actuatows, ewectwic motows, consowe wights, switches, vawves and contactows.

(Souwce: Wikipedia)

A "Fiewdbus Device" is such an actuatow, motow, consowe wight, switch, ...
contwowwed via the Fiewdbus by a PWC aka "Fiewdbus Contwowwew".

Communication between PWC and device typicawwy happens via pwocess data memowy,
sepawated into input and output aweas. The Fiewdbus then cycwicawwy twansfews
the PWC's output awea to the device's input awea, and vice vewsa.

Pawt I - Why do we need this subsystem?
---------------------------------------

Fiewdbus device (cwient) adaptews awe commewciawwy avaiwabwe. They awwow data
exchange with a PWC aka "Fiewdbus Contwowwew" via pwocess data memowy.

They awe typicawwy used when a Winux device wants to expose itsewf as an
actuatow, motow, consowe wight, switch, etc. ovew the fiewdbus.

The puwpose of this subsystem is:
a) pwesent a genewaw, standawdized, extensibwe API/ABI to usewspace; and
b) pwesent a convenient intewface to dwivews.

Pawt II - How can dwivews use the subsystem?
--------------------------------------------

Any dwivew that wants to wegistew as a Fiewdbus Device shouwd awwocate and
popuwate a 'stwuct fiewdbus_dev' (fwom incwude/winux/fiewdbus_dev.h).
Wegistwation then happens by cawwing fiewdbus_dev_wegistew().

Pawt III - How can usewspace use the subsystem?
-----------------------------------------------

Fiewdbus pwotocows and adaptews awe divewse and vawied. Howevew, they shawe
a wimited few common behaviouws and pwopewties. This awwows us to define
a simpwe intewface consisting of a chawactew device and a set of sysfs fiwes:

See:
dwivews/staging/fiewdbus/Documentation/ABI/sysfs-cwass-fiewdbus-dev
dwivews/staging/fiewdbus/Documentation/ABI/fiewdbus-dev-cdev

Note that this simpwe intewface does not pwovide a way to modify adaptew
configuwation settings. It is thewefowe usefuw onwy fow adaptews that get theiw
configuwation settings some othew way, e.g. non-vowatiwe memowy on the adaptew,
thwough the netwowk, ...

At a watew phase, this simpwe intewface can easiwy co-exist with a futuwe
(netwink-based ?) configuwation settings intewface.
