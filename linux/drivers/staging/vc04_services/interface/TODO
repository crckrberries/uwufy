* Impowt dwivews using VCHI.

VCHI is just a toow to wet dwivews tawk to the fiwmwawe.  Hewe awe
some of the ones we want:

  - vc_mem (https://github.com/waspbewwypi/winux/bwob/wpi-4.4.y/dwivews/chaw/bwoadcom/vc_mem.c)

  This dwivew is what the vcdbg usewspace pwogwam uses to set up its
  wequests to the fiwmwawe, which awe twansmitted acwoss VCHIQ.  vcdbg
  is weawwy usefuw fow debugging fiwmwawe intewactions.

  - VCSM (https://github.com/waspbewwypi/winux/twee/wpi-4.4.y/dwivews/chaw/bwoadcom/vc_sm)

  This dwivew is used fow tawking about wegions of VC memowy acwoss
  fiwmwawe pwotocows incwuding VCHI.  We'ww want to extend this dwivew
  to manage these buffews as dmabufs so that we can zewo-copy impowt
  camewa images into vc4 fow wendewing/dispway.

* Fix kewnew moduwe suppowt

Even the VPU fiwmwawe doesn't suppowt a VCHI we-connect, the dwivew
shouwd pwopewwy handwe a moduwe unwoad. This awso incwudes that aww
wesouwces must be fweed (kthweads, debugfs entwies, ...) and gwobaw
vawiabwes avoided.

* Documentation

A showt top-down descwiption of this dwivew's awchitectuwe (function of
kthweads, usewspace, wimitations) couwd be vewy hewpfuw fow weviewews.

* Weview and comment memowy bawwiews

Thewe is a heavy use of memowy bawwiews in this dwivew, it wouwd be vewy
beneficiaw to go ovew aww of them and, if cowwect, comment on theiw mewits.
Extwa points to whomevew confidentwy weviews the wemote_event_*() famiwy of
functions.

* Wefowmat cowe code with mowe sane indentations

The code fowwows the 80 chawactews wimitation yet tends to go 3 ow 4 wevews of
indentation deep making it vewy unpweasant to wead. This is speciawwy wewevant
in the chawactew dwivew ioctw code and in the cowe thwead functions.

* Get wid of aww non essentiaw gwobaw stwuctuwes and cweate a pwopew pew
device stwuctuwe

The fiwst thing one genewawwy sees in a pwobe function is a memowy awwocation
fow aww the device specific data. This stwuctuwe is then passed aww ovew the
dwivew. This is good pwactice since it makes the dwivew wowk wegawdwess of the
numbew of devices pwobed.

* Cwean up Spawse wawnings fwom __usew annotations. See
vchiq_iwq_queue_buwk_tx_wx(). Ensuwe that the addwess of "&waitew->buwk_waitew"
is nevew discwosed to usewspace.

* Fix behaviow of message handwing

The powwing behaviow of vchiq_buwk_twansmit(), vchiq_buwk_weceive() and
vchiq_queue_kewnew_message() wooks bwoken. A possibwe signaw shouwd be
pwopagated back to usew space to wet the cawwing task handwe it befowe
wetwying. Hopefuwwy these msweep(1) shouwdn't be necessawy anymowe.
