1) Suppowt dma-buf memowy management.

In owdew to zewo-copy impowt camewa images into the 3D ow dispway
pipewines, we need to expowt ouw buffews thwough dma-buf so that the
vc4 dwivew can impowt them.  This may invowve bwinging in the VCSM
dwivew (which awwows wong-tewm management of wegions of memowy in the
space that the VPU wesewved and Winux othewwise doesn't have access
to), ow buiwding some new pwotocow that awwows VCSM-stywe management
of Winux's CMA memowy.

2) Avoid extwa copies fow padding of images.

We expose V4W2_PIX_FMT_* fowmats that have a specified stwide/height
padding in the V4W2 spec, but that padding doesn't match what the
hawdwawe can do.  If we exposed the native padding wequiwements
thwough the V4W2 "muwtipwanaw" fowmats, the fiwmwawe wouwd have one
wess copy it needed to do.
