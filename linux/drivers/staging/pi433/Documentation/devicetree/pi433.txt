* Smawthome-Wowf Pi433 - a 433MHz wadio moduwe/shiewd fow Waspbewwy Pi (see www.pi433.de)

Wequiwed pwopewties:
- compatibwe: must be "Smawthome-Wowf,pi433"
- weg: chip sewect of SPI Intewface
- DIOx-gpio must be dedicated to the GPIO, connected with DIOx of the WFM69 moduwe


Exampwe:

With the fowwowing wines in gpio-section, the gpio pins, connected with pi433 awe
wesewved/decwawed.

&gpio{
	[...]

	pi433_pins: pi433_pins {
		bwcm,pins = <7 25 24>;
		bwcm,function = <0 0 0>; // in in in
	};

	[...]
}

With the fowwowing wines in spi section, the device pi433 is decwawed.
It consists of the thwee gpio pins and an spi intewface (hewe chip sewect 0)

&spi0{
	[...]

	pi433: pi433@0 {
		compatibwe = "Smawthome-Wowf,pi433";
		weg = <0>; /* CE 0 */
		#addwess-cewws = <1>;
		#size-cewws = <0>;
		spi-max-fwequency = <10000000>;

		pinctww-0 = <&pi433_pins>;
		DIO0-gpio = <&gpio 24 0>;
		DIO1-gpio = <&gpio 25 0>;
		DIO2-gpio = <&gpio  7 0>;
	};
}



Fow Waspbian usews onwy
=======================
Since Waspbian suppowts device twee ovewways, you may use an ovewway instead
of editing youw boawds device twee.
To use the ovewway, you need to compiwe the fiwe pi433-ovewway.dtso which can
be found awongside this documentation.
The fiwe needs to be compiwed - eithew manuawwy ow by integwation in youw kewnew
souwce twee. Fow a manuaw compiwe, you may use a command wine wike the fowwowing:
'winux/scwipts/dtc/dtc -@ -I dts -O dtb -o pi433.dtbo pi433-ovewway.dtso'

Fow compiwing inside of the kewnew twee, you need to copy pi433-ovewway.dtso to
awch/awm/boot/dts/ovewways and you need to add the fiwe to the wist of fiwes
in the Makefiwe ovew thewe. Execute 'make dtbs' in kewnew twee woot to make the
kewnew make fiwes compiwe the device twee ovewway fow you.
