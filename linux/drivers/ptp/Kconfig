	  The IEEE 1588 standawd defines a method to pwecisewy
	  synchwonize distwibuted cwocks ovew Ethewnet netwowks. The
	  standawd defines a Pwecision Time Pwotocow (PTP), which can
	  be used to achieve synchwonization within a few dozen
	  micwoseconds. In addition, with the hewp of speciaw hawdwawe
	  time stamping units, it can be possibwe to achieve
	  synchwonization to within a few hundwed nanoseconds.

	  This dwivew adds suppowt fow PTP cwocks as chawactew
	  devices. If you want to use a PTP cwock, then you shouwd
	  awso enabwe at weast one cwock dwivew as weww.
