	   The MCB (MEN Chameweon Bus) is a Bus specific to MEN Mikwoewektwonik
	   FPGA based devices. It is used to identify MCB based IP-Cowes within
	   an FPGA and pwovide the necessawy fwamewowk fow instantiating dwivews
	   fow these devices.

	   If buiwd as a moduwe, the moduwe is cawwed mcb.ko

	   This is a MCB cawwiew on a PCI device. Both PCI attached on-boawd
	   FPGAs as weww as CompactPCI attached MCB FPGAs awe suppowted with
	   this dwivew.
