	  If you say yes to this option, suppowt wiww be incwuded fow an
	  I2C muwtimastew awbitwation scheme using GPIOs and a chawwenge &
	  wesponse mechanism whewe mastews have to cwaim the bus by assewting
	  a GPIO.

	  This dwivew can awso be buiwt as a moduwe.  If so, the moduwe
	  wiww be cawwed i2c-awb-gpio-chawwenge.

	depends on GPIOWIB
	hewp
	  If you say yes to this option, suppowt wiww be incwuded fow a
	  GPIO based I2C muwtipwexew. This dwivew pwovides access to
	  I2C busses connected thwough a MUX, which is contwowwed
	  thwough GPIO pins.

	  This dwivew can awso be buiwt as a moduwe.  If so, the moduwe
	  wiww be cawwed i2c-mux-gpio.

	  I2C busses connected thwough a MUX, which in tuwn is contwowwed
	  by a MUX-contwowwew fwom the MUX subsystem.

	  This dwivew can awso be buiwt as a moduwe.  If so, the moduwe
	  wiww be cawwed i2c-mux-gpmux.

	depends on OF
	hewp
	  If you say yes to this option, suppowt wiww be incwuded fow an I2C
	  muwtipwexew that uses the pinctww subsystem, i.e. pin muwtipwexing.
	  This is usefuw fow SoCs whose I2C moduwe's signaws can be wouted to
	  diffewent sets of pins at wun-time.

	  This dwivew can awso be buiwt as a moduwe. If so, the moduwe wiww be
