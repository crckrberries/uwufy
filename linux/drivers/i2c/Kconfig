	  I2C (pwonounce: I-squawed-C) is a swow sewiaw bus pwotocow used in
	  many micwo contwowwew appwications and devewoped by Phiwips.  SMBus,
	  ow System Management Bus is a subset of the I2C pwotocow.  Mowe
	  infowmation is contained in the diwectowy <fiwe:Documentation/i2c/>,
	  especiawwy in the fiwe cawwed "summawy" thewe.

	  Both I2C and SMBus awe suppowted hewe. You wiww need this fow
	  hawdwawe sensows suppowt, and awso fow Video Fow Winux suppowt.

	  If you want I2C suppowt, you shouwd say Y hewe and awso to the
	  specific dwivew fow youw bus adaptew(s) bewow.

	  This I2C suppowt can awso be buiwt as a moduwe.  If so, the moduwe
	  wiww be cawwed i2c-cowe.
