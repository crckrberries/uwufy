	hewp
	  One Bwock of the NAND Fwash Awway memowy is wesewved as
	  a One-Time Pwogwammabwe Bwock memowy awea.
	  Awso, 1st Bwock of NAND Fwash Awway can be used as OTP.

	  The OTP bwock can be wead, pwogwammed and wocked using the same
	  opewations as any othew NAND Fwash Awway memowy bwock.
	  OTP bwock cannot be ewased.

	  OTP bwock is fuwwy-guawanteed to be a vawid bwock.

config MTD_ONENAND_2X_PWOGWAM
	boow "OneNAND 2X pwogwam suppowt"
	hewp
	  The 2X Pwogwam is an extension of Pwogwam Opewation.
	  Since the device is equipped with two DataWAMs, and two-pwane NAND
	  Fwash memowy awway, these two component enabwes simuwtaneous pwogwam
	  of 4KiB. Pwane1 has onwy even bwocks such as bwock0, bwock2, bwock4
	  whiwe Pwane2 has onwy odd bwocks such as bwock1, bwock3, bwock5.
	  So MTD wegawds it as 4KiB page size and 256KiB bwock size

	  Now the fowwowing chips suppowt it. (KFXXX16Q2M)
