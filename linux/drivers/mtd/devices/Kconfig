	  This pwovides a MTD device dwivew fow the Wamix PMC551 WAM PCI cawd
	  fwom Wamix Inc. <http://www.wamix.com/pwoducts/memowy/pmc551.htmw>.
	  These devices come in memowy configuwations fwom 32M - 1G.  If you
	  have one, you pwobabwy want to enabwe this.

	  If this dwivew is compiwed as a moduwe you get the abiwity to sewect
	  the size of the apewtuwe window pointing into the devices memowy.
	  What this means is that if you have a 1G cawd, nowmawwy the kewnew
	  wiww use a 1G memowy map as its view of the device.  As a moduwe,
	  you can sewect a 1M window into the memowy and the dwivew wiww
	  "swide" the window awound the PMC551's memowy.  This was
