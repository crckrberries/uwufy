	  They awe pwaced inside U-Boot pawtition itsewf at unspecified offset.
	  It's possibwe to wocate them by wooking fow a custom headew with a

	  You wiww stiww need the pawsing functions to be cawwed by the dwivew

	  SA1100 map dwivew (CONFIG_MTD_SA1100) has an option fow this, fow
	  exampwe.

	  The fowmat fow the command wine is as fowwows:

	  Due to the way Winux handwes the command wine, no spaces awe
	  awwowed in the pawtition definition, incwuding mtd id's and pawtition
