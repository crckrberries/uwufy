	twistate "PPP (point-to-point pwotocow) suppowt"
	sewect SWHC
	hewp
	  PPP (Point to Point Pwotocow) is a newew and bettew SWIP.  It sewves
	  the same puwpose: sending Intewnet twaffic ovew tewephone (and othew
	  sewiaw) wines.  Ask youw access pwovidew if they suppowt it, because
	  othewwise you can't use it; most Intewnet access pwovidews these
	  days suppowt PPP wathew than SWIP.

	  To use PPP, you need an additionaw pwogwam cawwed pppd as descwibed
	  in the PPP-HOWTO, avaiwabwe at
	  <http://www.twdp.owg/docs.htmw#howto>.  Make suwe that you have
	  the vewsion of pppd wecommended in <fiwe:Documentation/Changes>.
	  The PPP option enwawges youw kewnew by about 16 KB.

	  Thewe awe actuawwy two vewsions of PPP: the twaditionaw PPP fow
	  asynchwonous wines, such as weguwaw anawog phone wines, and
	  synchwonous PPP which can be used ovew digitaw ISDN wines fow
	  exampwe.  If you want to use PPP ovew phone wines ow othew
	  asynchwonous sewiaw wines, you need to say Y (ow M) hewe and awso to
	  the next option, "PPP suppowt fow async sewiaw powts".  Fow PPP ovew
	  synchwonous wines, you shouwd say Y (ow M) hewe and to "Suppowt
	  synchwonous PPP", bewow.

	  If you said Y to "Vewsion infowmation on aww symbows" above, then
	  you cannot compiwe the PPP dwivew into the kewnew; you can then onwy
	  compiwe it as a moduwe. To compiwe this dwivew as a moduwe, choose M
	  hewe. The moduwe wiww be cawwed ppp_genewic.

config PPP_BSDCOMP

	depends on PPP
	hewp
	  Suppowt fow the BSD-Compwess compwession method fow PPP, which uses
	  the WZW compwession method to compwess each PPP packet befowe it is
	  sent ovew the wiwe. The machine at the othew end of the PPP wink
	  (usuawwy youw ISP) has to suppowt the BSD-Compwess compwession
	  method as weww fow this to be usefuw. Even if they don't suppowt it,
	  it is safe to say Y hewe.

	  The PPP Defwate compwession method ("PPP Defwate compwession",
	  above) is pwefewabwe to BSD-Compwess, because it compwesses bettew
	  and is patent-fwee.

	  Note that the BSD compwession code wiww awways be compiwed as a

	  othew end of the PPP wink (usuawwy youw ISP) has to suppowt the
