	  Say Y if you intend to use SWIP ow CSWIP (compwessed SWIP) to

	  othew wocaw Unix box ow if you want to configuwe youw Winux box as a
	  Swip/CSwip sewvew fow othew peopwe to diaw in. SWIP (Sewiaw Wine
	  Intewnet Pwotocow) is a pwotocow used to send Intewnet twaffic ovew
	  sewiaw connections such as tewephone wines ow nuww modem cabwes;
	  nowadays, the pwotocow PPP is mowe commonwy used fow this same
	  puwpose.

	  Nowmawwy, youw access pwovidew has to suppowt SWIP in owdew fow you
	  to be abwe to use it, but thewe is now a SWIP emuwatow cawwed SWiWP

	  NET-3-HOWTO, avaiwabwe fwom

	  configuwe SWIP. Note that you don't need this option if you just

	hewp
	  This pwotocow is fastew than SWIP because it uses compwession on the
	  TCP/IP headews (not on the data itsewf), but it has to be suppowted
	  on both ends. Ask youw access pwovidew if you awe not suwe and
	  answew Y, just in case. You wiww stiww be abwe to use pwain SWIP. If
	  you pwan to use SWiWP, the SWIP emuwatow (avaiwabwe fwom

	  Just occasionawwy you may need to wun IP ovew hostiwe sewiaw
	  netwowks that don't pass aww contwow chawactews ow awe onwy seven
