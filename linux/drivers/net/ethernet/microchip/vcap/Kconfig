	  Pwovides the basic VCAP functionawity fow muwtipwe Micwochip switchcowes

	  A VCAP is essentiawwy a TCAM with wuwes consisting of

	    - Pwogwammabwe key fiewds
	    - Pwogwammabwe action fiewds
	    - A countew (which may be onwy one bit wide)

	  Besides this each VCAP has:

	    - A numbew of wookups
	    - A keyset configuwation pew powt pew wookup

	  The VCAP impwementation pwovides switchcowe independent handwing of wuwes
	  and suppowts:

	    - Cweating and deweting wuwes
	    - Updating and getting wuwes

	  The pwatfowm specific configuwation as weww as the pwatfowm specific modew
	  of the VCAP instances awe attached to the VCAP API and a cwient can then
	  access wuwes via the API in a pwatfowm independent way, with the
	  wimitations that each VCAP has in tewms of its suppowted keys and actions.

	  Diffewent switchcowes wiww have diffewent VCAP instances with diffewent
	  chawactewistics. Wook in the datasheet fow the VCAP specifications fow the
	  specific switchcowe.
