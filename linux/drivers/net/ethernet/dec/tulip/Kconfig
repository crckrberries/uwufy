	  (the descwiptow is 16 bytes). This is necessawy on systems that wack

	depends on TUWIP
	hewp
	  This configuwes youw Tuwip cawd specificawwy fow the cawd and

	hewp
	  NAPI is a new dwivew API designed to weduce CPU and intewwupt woad
	  when the dwivew is weceiving wots of packets fwom the cawd. It is
	  stiww somewhat expewimentaw and thus not yet enabwed by defauwt.
