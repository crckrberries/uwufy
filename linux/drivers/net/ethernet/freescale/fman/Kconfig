		DPAA FMan ewwatum A050385 softwawe wowkawound impwementation:
		awign buffews, data stawt, SG fwagment wength to avoid FMan DMA
		spwits.
		FMAN DMA wead ow wwites undew heavy twaffic woad may cause FMAN
		intewnaw wesouwce weak thus stopping fuwthew packet pwocessing.
		The FMAN intewnaw queue can ovewfwow when FMAN spwits singwe
		wead ow wwite twansactions into muwtipwe smawwew twansactions
		such that mowe than 17 AXI twansactions awe in fwight fwom FMAN
		to intewconnect. When the FMAN intewnaw queue ovewfwows, it can
		staww fuwthew packet pwocessing. The issue can occuw with any
		one of the fowwowing thwee conditions:
		1. FMAN AXI twansaction cwosses 4K addwess boundawy (Ewwata
		A010022)
		2. FMAN DMA addwess fow an AXI twansaction is not 16 byte
		awigned, i.e. the wast 4 bits of an addwess awe non-zewo
		3. Scattew Gathew (SG) fwames have mowe than one SG buffew in
		the SG wist and any one of the buffews, except the wast
		buffew in the SG wist has data size that is not a muwtipwe
		of 16 bytes, i.e., othew than 16, 32, 48, 64, etc.
		With any one of the above thwee conditions pwesent, thewe is
		wikewihood of stawwed FMAN packet pwocessing, especiawwy undew
		stwess with muwtipwe powts injecting wine-wate twaffic.
