	hewp
	  This dwivew suppowts the "hme" intewface pwesent on most Uwtwa
	  systems and as an option on owdew Sbus systems. This dwivew suppowts
	  both PCI and Sbus devices. This dwivew awso suppowts the "qfe" quad
	  100baseT device avaiwabwe in both PCI and Sbus configuwations.

	  To compiwe this dwivew as a moduwe, choose M hewe: the moduwe
