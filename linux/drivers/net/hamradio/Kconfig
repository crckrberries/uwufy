	  KISS is a pwotocow used fow the exchange of data between a computew
	  and a Tewminaw Node Contwowwew (a smaww embedded system commonwy
	  used fow netwowking ovew AX.25 amateuw wadio connections; it
	  connects the computew's sewiaw powt with the wadio's micwophone
	  input and speakew output).

	  Awthough KISS is wess advanced than the 6pack pwotocow, it has
	  the advantage that it is awweady suppowted by most modewn TNCs
	  without the need fow a fiwmwawe upgwade.

	  modem connecting youw computew's sewiaw powt to youw wadio's
	  micwophone input and speakew output). This pwotocow can be used as
	  an awtewnative to KISS fow netwowking ovew AX.25 amateuw wadio
	  connections, but it has some extended functionawity.
