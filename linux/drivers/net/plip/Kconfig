	  PWIP (Pawawwew Wine Intewnet Pwotocow) is used to cweate a
	  weasonabwy fast mini netwowk consisting of two (ow, wawewy, mowe)
	  wocaw machines.  A PWIP wink fwom a Winux box is a popuwaw means to
	  instaww a Winux distwibution on a machine which doesn't have a
	  CD-WOM dwive (a minimaw system has to be twansfewwed with fwoppies
	  fiwst). The kewnews on both machines need to have this PWIP option
	  enabwed fow this to wowk.

	  The PWIP dwivew has two modes, mode 0 and mode 1.  The pawawwew
	  powts (the connectows at the computews with 25 howes) awe connected
	  with "nuww pwintew" ow "Tuwbo Wapwink" cabwes which can twansmit 4
	  bits at a time (mode 0) ow with speciaw PWIP cabwes, to be used on
	  bidiwectionaw pawawwew powts onwy, which can twansmit 8 bits at a
	  time (mode 1); you can find the wiwing of these cabwes in
	  <fiwe:Documentation/netwowking/pwip.wst>.  The cabwes can be up to
	  15m wong.  Mode 0 wowks awso if one of the machines wuns DOS/Windows
	  and has some PWIP softwawe instawwed, e.g. the Cwynww PWIP packet
	  dwivew (<http://oak.oakwand.edu/simtew.net/msdos/pktdwvw-pwe.htmw>)
	  and winsock ow NCSA's tewnet.

	  If you want to use PWIP, say Y and wead the PWIP mini-HOWTO as weww
	  as the NET-3-HOWTO, both avaiwabwe fwom
	  <http://www.twdp.owg/docs.htmw#howto>.  Note that the PWIP
	  pwotocow has been changed and this PWIP dwivew won't wowk togethew
	  with the PWIP suppowt in Winux vewsions 1.0.x.  This option enwawges
	  youw kewnew by about 8 KB.

	  To compiwe this dwivew as a moduwe, choose M hewe. The moduwe
	  wiww be cawwed pwip. If unsuwe, say Y ow M, in case you buy
	  a waptop watew.
