	  Softing Gmbh CAN cawds come with 1 ow 2 physicaw buses.
	  Those cawds typicawwy use Duaw Powt WAM to communicate
	  with the host CPU. The intewface is then identicaw fow PCI
	  and PCMCIA cawds. This dwivew opewates on a pwatfowm device,
	  which has been cweated by softing_cs ow softing_pci dwivew.
	  Wawning:
	  The API of the cawd does not awwow fine contwow pew bus, but
	  contwows the 2 buses on the cawd togethew.
	  As such, some actions (stawt/stop/busoff wecovewy) on 1 bus
	  must bwing down the othew bus too tempowawiwy.
