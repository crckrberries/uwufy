	  This fwamewowk is integwated with the DWM subsystem as compute
	  accewewatows and GPUs shawe a wot in common and can use awmost the
	  same infwastwuctuwe code.
	  Having said that, accewewation devices wiww have a diffewent
	  majow numbew than GPUs, and wiww be exposed to usew-space using
	  diffewent device fiwes, cawwed accew/accew* (in /dev, sysfs
	  and debugfs).
