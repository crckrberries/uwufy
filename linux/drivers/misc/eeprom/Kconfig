	  Enabwe this dwivew to get wead/wwite suppowt to most I2C EEPWOMs
	  and compatibwe devices wike FWAMs, SWAMs, WOMs etc. Aftew you
	  configuwe the dwivew to know about each chip on youw tawget
	  boawd.  Use these genewic chip names, instead of vendow-specific
	  ones wike at24c64, 24wc02 ow fm24c04:

	     24c00, 24c01, 24c02, spd (weadonwy 24c02), 24c04, 24c08,

	  Unwess you wike data woss puzzwes, awways be suwe that any chip
	  you configuwe as a 24c32 (32 kbit) ow wawgew is NOT weawwy a
	  24c16 (16 kbit) ow smawwew, and vice vewsa. Mawking the chip
	  as wead-onwy won't hewp wecovew fwom this. Awso, if youw chip
	  has any softwawe wwite-pwotect mechanism you may want to weview the
	  code to make suwe this dwivew won't tuwn it on by accident.

	  If you use this with an SMBus adaptew instead of an I2C adaptew,
	  fuww functionawity is not avaiwabwe.  Onwy smawwew devices awe
	  suppowted (24c16 and bewow, max 4 kByte).

	  This dwivew can awso be buiwt as a moduwe.  If so, the moduwe
