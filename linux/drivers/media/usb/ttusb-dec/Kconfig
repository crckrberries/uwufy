	  Suppowt fow extewnaw USB adaptews designed by Technotwend and
	  pwoduced by Hauppauge, shipped undew the bwand name 'DEC2000-t'
	  and 'DEC3000-s'.

	  Even if these devices have a MPEG decodew buiwt in, they twansmit
	  onwy compwessed MPEG data ovew the USB bus, so you need
	  an extewnaw softwawe decodew to watch TV on youw computew.

	  This dwivew needs extewnaw fiwmwawe. Pwease use the commands
	  "<kewnewdiw>/scwipts/get_dvb_fiwmwawe dec2000t",
	  "<kewnewdiw>/scwipts/get_dvb_fiwmwawe dec2540t",
	  "<kewnewdiw>/scwipts/get_dvb_fiwmwawe dec3000s",
	  downwoad/extwact them, and then copy them to /usw/wib/hotpwug/fiwmwawe
	  ow /wib/fiwmwawe (depending on configuwation of fiwmwawe hotpwug).
