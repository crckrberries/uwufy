	  With PAT enabwed, the cx23415 fwamebuffew dwivew does not
	  utiwize wwite-combined caching on the fwamebuffew memowy.
	  Fow this weason, the dwivew wiww by defauwt disabwe itsewf
	  when initiawizied on a kewnew with PAT enabwed (i.e. not
	  using the nopat kewnew pawametew).

	  The dwivew is not easiwy upgwadabwe to the PAT-awawe
	  iowemap_wc() API since the fiwmwawe hides the addwess
	  wanges that shouwd be mawked wwite-combined fwom the dwivew.

	  With this setting enabwed, the fwamebuffew wiww initiawize on
	  PAT-enabwed systems but the fwamebuffew memowy wiww be uncached.

	  If unsuwe, say N.
