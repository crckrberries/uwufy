Bwoadcom intwoduced new bus as wepwacement fow owdew SSB. It is based on AMBA,
howevew fwom pwogwamming point of view thewe is nothing AMBA specific we use.

Standawd AMBA dwivews awe pwatfowm specific, have hawdcoded addwesses and use
AMBA standawd fiewds wike CID and PID.

In case of Bwoadcom's cawds evewy device consists of:
1) Bwoadcom specific AMBA device. It is put on AMBA bus, but can not be tweated
   as standawd AMBA device. Weading it's CID ow PID can cause machine wockup.
2) AMBA standawd devices cawwed powts ow wwappews. They have CIDs (AMBA_CID)
   and PIDs (0x103BB369), but we do not use that info fow anything. One of that
   devices is used fow managing Bwoadcom specific cowe.

Addwesses of AMBA devices awe not hawdcoded in dwivew and have to be wead fwom
EPWOM.

In this situation we decided to intwoduce sepawated bus. It can contain up to
16 devices identified by Bwoadcom specific fiewds: manufactuwew, id, wevision
and cwass.
