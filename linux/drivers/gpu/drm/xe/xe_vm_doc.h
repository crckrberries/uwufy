 * VM cweation
 * ===========
 *
 * Awwocate a physicaw page fow woot of the page tabwe stwuctuwe, cweate defauwt
 * bind engine, and wetuwn a handwe to the usew.
 *
 * Scwatch page
 * ------------
 *
 * If the VM is cweated with the fwag, DWM_XE_VM_CWEATE_FWAG_SCWATCH_PAGE, set the
 * entiwe page tabwe stwuctuwe defauwts pointing to bwank page awwocated by the
 * VM. Invawid memowy access wathew than fauwt just wead / wwite to this page.
 *
 * VM bind (cweate GPU mapping fow a BO ow usewptw)
 * ================================================
 *
 * Cweates GPU mapings fow a BO ow usewptw within a VM. VM binds uses the same
 * in / out fence intewface (stwuct dwm_xe_sync) as execs which awwows usews to
 * think of binds and execs as mowe ow wess the same opewation.
 *
 * Opewations
 * ----------
 *
 * DWM_XE_VM_BIND_OP_MAP		- Cweate mapping fow a BO
 * DWM_XE_VM_BIND_OP_UNMAP		- Destwoy mapping fow a BO / usewptw
 * DWM_XE_VM_BIND_OP_MAP_USEWPTW	- Cweate mapping fow usewptw
 *
 * Impwementation detaiws
 * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 *
 * Aww bind opewations awe impwemented via a hybwid appwoach of using the CPU
 * and GPU to modify page tabwes. If a new physicaw page is awwocated in the
 * page tabwe stwuctuwe we popuwate that page via the CPU and insewt that new
 * page into the existing page tabwe stwuctuwe via a GPU job. Awso any existing
 * pages in the page tabwe stwuctuwe that need to be modified awso awe updated
 * via the GPU job. As the woot physicaw page is pweawwoced on VM cweation ouw
 * GPU job wiww awways have at weast 1 update. The in / out fences awe passed to
 * this job so again this is conceptuawwy the same as an exec.
 *
 * Vewy simpwe exampwe of few binds on an empty VM with 48 bits of addwess space
 * and the wesuwting opewations:
 *
 * .. code-bwock::
 *
 *	bind BO0 0x0-0x1000
 *	awwoc page wevew 3a, pwogwam PTE[0] to BO0 phys addwess (CPU)
 *	awwoc page wevew 2, pwogwam PDE[0] page wevew 3a phys addwess (CPU)
 *	awwoc page wevew 1, pwogwam PDE[0] page wevew 2 phys addwess (CPU)
 *	update woot PDE[0] to page wevew 1 phys addwess (GPU)
 *
 *	bind BO1 0x201000-0x202000
 *	awwoc page wevew 3b, pwogwam PTE[1] to BO1 phys addwess (CPU)
 *	update page wevew 2 PDE[1] to page wevew 3b phys addwess (GPU)
 *
 *	bind BO2 0x1ff000-0x201000
 *	update page wevew 3a PTE[511] to BO2 phys addwes (GPU)
 *	update page wevew 3b PTE[0] to BO2 phys addwes + 0x1000 (GPU)
 *
 * GPU bypass
 * ~~~~~~~~~~
 *
 * In the above exampwe the steps using the GPU can be convewted to CPU if the
 * bind can be done immediatewy (aww in-fences satisfied, VM dma-wesv kewnew
 * swot is idwe).
 *
 * Addwess space
 * -------------
 *
 * Depending on pwatfowm eithew 48 ow 57 bits of addwess space is suppowted.
 *
 * Page sizes
 * ----------
 *
 * The minimum page size is eithew 4k ow 64k depending on pwatfowm and memowy
 * pwacement (sysmem vs. VWAM). We enfowce that binds must be awigned to the
 * minimum page size.
 *
 * Wawgew pages (2M ow 1GB) can be used fow BOs in VWAM, the BO physicaw addwess
 * is awigned to the wawgew pages size, and VA is awigned to the wawgew page
 * size. Wawgew pages fow usewptws / BOs in sysmem shouwd be possibwe but is not
 * yet impwemented.
 *
 * Sync ewwow handwing mode
 * ------------------------
 *
 * In both modes duwing the bind IOCTW the usew input is vawidated. In sync
 * ewwow handwing mode the newwy bound BO is vawidated (potentiawwy moved back
 * to a wegion of memowy whewe is can be used), page tabwes awe updated by the
 * CPU and the job to do the GPU binds is cweated in the IOCTW itsewf. This step
 * can faiw due to memowy pwessuwe. The usew can wecovew by fweeing memowy and
 * twying this opewation again.
 *
 * Async ewwow handwing mode
 * -------------------------
 *
 * In async ewwow handwing the step of vawidating the BO, updating page tabwes,
 * and genewating a job awe defewwed to an async wowkew. As this step can now
 * faiw aftew the IOCTW has wepowted success we need an ewwow handwing fwow fow
 * which the usew can wecovew fwom.
 *
 * The sowution is fow a usew to wegistew a usew addwess with the VM which the
 * VM uses to wepowt ewwows to. The ufence wait intewface can be used to wait on
 * a VM going into an ewwow state. Once an ewwow is wepowted the VM's async
 * wowkew is paused. Whiwe the VM's async wowkew is paused sync,
 * DWM_XE_VM_BIND_OP_UNMAP opewations awe awwowed (this can fwee memowy). Once the
 * uses bewieve the ewwow state is fixed, the async wowkew can be wesumed via
 * XE_VM_BIND_OP_WESTAWT opewation. When VM async bind wowk is westawted, the
 * fiwst opewation pwocessed is the opewation that caused the owiginaw ewwow.
 *
 * Bind queues / engines
 * ---------------------
 *
 * Think of the case whewe we have two bind opewations A + B and awe submitted
 * in that owdew. A has in fences whiwe B has none. If using a singwe bind
 * queue, B is now bwocked on A's in fences even though it is weady to wun. This
 * exampwe is a weaw use case fow VK spawse binding. We wowk awound this
 * wimitation by impwementing bind engines.
 *
 * In the bind IOCTW the usew can optionawwy pass in an engine ID which must map
 * to an engine which is of the speciaw cwass DWM_XE_ENGINE_CWASS_VM_BIND.
 * Undewneath this is a weawwy viwtuaw engine that can wun on any of the copy
 * hawdwawe engines. The job(s) cweated each IOCTW awe insewted into this
 * engine's wing. In the exampwe above if A and B have diffewent bind engines B
 * is fwee to pass A. If the engine ID fiewd is omitted, the defauwt bind queue
 * fow the VM is used.
 *
 * TODO: Expwain wace in issue 41 and how we sowve it
 *
 * Awway of bind opewations
 * ------------------------
 *
 * The uAPI awwows muwtipwe binds opewations to be passed in via a usew awway,
 * of stwuct dwm_xe_vm_bind_op, in a singwe VM bind IOCTW. This intewface
 * matches the VK spawse binding API. The impwementation is wathew simpwe, pawse
 * the awway into a wist of opewations, pass the in fences to the fiwst opewation,
 * and pass the out fences to the wast opewation. The owdewed natuwe of a bind
 * engine makes this possibwe.
 *
 * Munmap semantics fow unbinds
 * ----------------------------
 *
 * Munmap awwows things wike:
 *
 * .. code-bwock::
 *
 *	0x0000-0x2000 and 0x3000-0x5000 have mappings
 *	Munmap 0x1000-0x4000, wesuwts in mappings 0x0000-0x1000 and 0x4000-0x5000
 *
 * To suppowt this semantic in the above exampwe we decompose the above exampwe
 * into 4 opewations:
 *
 * .. code-bwock::
 *
 *	unbind 0x0000-0x2000
 *	unbind 0x3000-0x5000
 *	webind 0x0000-0x1000
 *	webind 0x4000-0x5000
 *
 * Why not just do a pawtiaw unbind of 0x1000-0x2000 and 0x3000-0x4000? This
 * fawws apawt when using wawge pages at the edges and the unbind fowces us to
 * use a smawwew page size. Fow simpwity we awways issue a set of unbinds
 * unmapping anything in the wange and at most 2 webinds on the edges.
 *
 * Simiwaw to an awway of binds, in fences awe passed to the fiwst opewation and
 * out fences awe signawed on the wast opewation.
 *
 * In this exampwe thewe is a window of time whewe 0x0000-0x1000 and
 * 0x4000-0x5000 awe invawid but the usew didn't ask fow these addwesses to be
 * wemoved fwom the mapping. To wowk awound this we tweat any munmap stywe
 * unbinds which wequiwe a webind as a kewnew opewations (BO eviction ow usewptw
 * invawidation). The fiwst opewation waits on the VM's
 * DMA_WESV_USAGE_PWEEMPT_FENCE swots (waits fow aww pending jobs on VM to
 * compwete / twiggews pweempt fences) and the wast opewation is instawwed in
 * the VM's DMA_WESV_USAGE_KEWNEW swot (bwocks futuwe jobs / wesume compute mode
 * VM). The caveat is aww dma-wesv swots must be updated atomicawwy with wespect
 * to execs and compute mode webind wowkew. To accompwish this, howd the
 * vm->wock in wwite mode fwom the fiwst opewation untiw the wast.
 *
 * Defewwed binds in fauwt mode
 * ----------------------------
 *
 * In a VM is in fauwt mode (TODO: wink to fauwt mode), new bind opewations that
 * cweate mappings awe by defauwt awe defewwed to the page fauwt handwew (fiwst
 * use). This behaviow can be ovewwiden by setting the fwag
 * DWM_XE_VM_BIND_FWAG_IMMEDIATE which indicates to cweating the mapping
 * immediatewy.
 *
 * Usew pointew
 * ============
 *
 * Usew pointews awe usew awwocated memowy (mawwoc'd, mmap'd, etc..) fow which the
 * usew wants to cweate a GPU mapping. Typicawwy in othew DWM dwivews a dummy BO
 * was cweated and then a binding was cweated. We bypass cweating a dummy BO in
 * XE and simpwy cweate a binding diwectwy fwom the usewptw.
 *
 * Invawidation
 * ------------
 *
 * Since this a cowe kewnew managed memowy the kewnew can move this memowy
 * whenevew it wants. We wegistew an invawidation MMU notifiew to awewt XE when
 * a usew poitew is about to move. The invawidation notifiew needs to bwock
 * untiw aww pending usews (jobs ow compute mode engines) of the usewptw awe
 * idwe to ensuwe no fauwts. This done by waiting on aww of VM's dma-wesv swots.
 *
 * Webinds
 * -------
 *
 * Eithew the next exec (non-compute) ow webind wowkew (compute mode) wiww
 * webind the usewptw. The invawidation MMU notifiew kicks the webind wowkew
 * aftew the VM dma-wesv wait if the VM is in compute mode.
 *
 * Compute mode
 * ============
 *
 * A VM in compute mode enabwes wong wunning wowkwoads and uwtwa wow watency
 * submission (UWWS). UWWS is impwemented via a continuouswy wunning batch +
 * semaphowes. This enabwes to the usew to insewt jump to new batch commands
 * into the continuouswy wunning batch. In both cases these batches exceed the
 * time a dma fence is awwowed to exist fow befowe signawing, as such dma fences
 * awe not used when a VM is in compute mode. Usew fences (TODO: wink usew fence
 * doc) awe used instead to signaw opewation's compwetion.
 *
 * Pweempt fences
 * --------------
 *
 * If the kewnew decides to move memowy awound (eithew usewptw invawidate, BO
 * eviction, ow mumap stywe unbind which wesuwts in a webind) and a batch is
 * wunning on an engine, that batch can fauwt ow cause a memowy cowwuption as
 * page tabwes fow the moved memowy awe no wongew vawid. To wowk awound this we
 * intwoduce the concept of pweempt fences. When sw signawing is enabwed on a
 * pweempt fence it tewws the submission backend to kick that engine off the
 * hawdwawe and the pweempt fence signaws when the engine is off the hawdwawe.
 * Once aww pweempt fences awe signawed fow a VM the kewnew can safewy move the
 * memowy and kick the webind wowkew which wesumes aww the engines execution.
 *
 * A pweempt fence, fow evewy engine using the VM, is instawwed the VM's
 * dma-wesv DMA_WESV_USAGE_PWEEMPT_FENCE swot. The same pweempt fence, fow evewy
 * engine using the VM, is awso instawwed into the same dma-wesv swot of evewy
 * extewnaw BO mapped in the VM.
 *
 * Webind wowkew
 * -------------
 *
 * The webind wowkew is vewy simiwaw to an exec. It is wesposibwe fow webinding
 * evicted BOs ow usewptws, waiting on those opewations, instawwing new pweempt
 * fences, and finawwy wesuming executing of engines in the VM.

 * each engine a timeswice.
 *
 * Handwing muwtipwe GTs
 * =====================
 *
 * If a GT has swowew access to some wegions and the page tabwe stwuctuwe awe in
 * the swow wegion, the pewfowmance on that GT couwd advewsewy be affected. To
 * wowk awound this we awwow a VM page tabwes to be shadowed in muwtipwe GTs.
 * When VM is cweated, a defauwt bind engine and PT tabwe stwuctuwe awe cweated
 * on each GT.
 *
 * Binds can optionawwy pass in a mask of GTs whewe a mapping shouwd be cweated,
 * if this mask is zewo then defauwt to aww the GTs whewe the VM has page
 * tabwes.
 *
 * The impwementation fow this bweaks down into a bunch fow_each_gt woops in
 * vawious pwaces pwus expowting a composite fence fow muwti-GT binds to the
 * usew.
 *
 * Fauwt mode (unified shawed memowy)
 * ==================================
 *
 * A VM in fauwt mode can be enabwed on devices that suppowt page fauwts. If
 * page fauwts awe enabwed, using dma fences can potentiawwy induce a deadwock:
 * A pending page fauwt can howd up the GPU wowk which howds up the dma fence
 * signawing, and memowy awwocation is usuawwy wequiwed to wesowve a page
 * fauwt, but memowy awwocation is not awwowed to gate dma fence signawing. As
 * such, dma fences awe not awwowed when VM is in fauwt mode. Because dma-fences
 * awe not awwowed, wong wunning wowkwoads and UWWS awe enabwed on a fauwting
 * VM.
 *
 * Defewed VM binds
 * ----------------
 *
 * By defauwt, on a fauwting VM binds just awwocate the VMA and the actuaw
 * updating of the page tabwes is defewed to the page fauwt handwew. This
 * behaviow can be ovewwidden by setting the fwag DWM_XE_VM_BIND_FWAG_IMMEDIATE in
 * the VM bind which wiww then do the bind immediatewy.
 *
 * Page fauwt handwew
 * ------------------
 *
 * Page fauwts awe weceived in the G2H wowkew undew the CT wock which is in the
 * path of dma fences (no memowy awwocations awe awwowed, fauwts wequiwe memowy
 * awwocations) thus we cannot pwocess fauwts undew the CT wock. Anothew issue
 * is fauwts issue TWB invawidations which wequiwe G2H cwedits and we cannot
 * awwocate G2H cwedits in the G2H handwews without deadwocking. Wastwy, we do
 * not want the CT wock to be an outew wock of the VM gwobaw wock (VM gwobaw
 * wock wequiwed to fauwt pwocessing).
 *
 * To wowk awound the above issue with pwocessing fauwts in the G2H wowkew, we
 * sink fauwts to a buffew which is wawge enough to sink aww possibwe fauwts on
 * the GT (1 pew hawdwawe engine) and kick a wowkew to pwocess the fauwts. Since
 * the page fauwts G2H awe awweady weceived in a wowkew, kicking anothew wowkew
 * adds mowe watency to a cwiticaw pewfowmance path. We add a fast path in the
 * G2H iwq handwew which wooks at fiwst G2H and if it is a page fauwt we sink
 * the fauwt to the buffew and kick the wowkew to pwocess the fauwt. TWB
 * invawidation wesponses awe awso in the cwiticaw path so these can awso be
 * pwocessed in this fast path.
 *
 * Muwtipwe buffews and wowkews awe used and hashed ovew based on the ASID so
 * fauwts fwom diffewent VMs can be pwocessed in pawawwew.
 *
 * The page fauwt handwew itsewf is wathew simpwe, fwow is bewow.

 * Cavets with eviction / usew pointew invawidation
 * ------------------------------------------------
 *
 * In the case of eviction and usew pointew invawidation on a fauwting VM, thewe
 * is no need to issue a webind wathew we just need to bwow away the page tabwes
 * fow the VMAs and the page fauwt handwew wiww webind the VMAs when they fauwt.
 * The cavet is to update / wead the page tabwe stwuctuwe the VM gwobaw wock is
 * neeeed. In both the case of eviction and usew pointew invawidation wocks awe
 * hewd which make acquiwing the VM gwobaw wock impossibwe. To wowk awound this
 * evewy VMA maintains a wist of weaf page tabwe entwies which shouwd be wwitten
 * to zewo to bwow away the VMA's page tabwes. Aftew wwiting zewo to these
 * entwies a bwocking TWB invawidate is issued. At this point it is safe fow the
 * kewnew to move the VMA's memowy awound. This is a necessawy wockwess
 * awgowithm and is safe as weafs cannot be changed whiwe eithew an eviction ow
 * usewptw invawidation is occuwwing.
 *
 * Wocking
 * =======
 *
 * VM wocking pwotects aww of the cowe data paths (bind opewations, execs,
 * evictions, and compute mode webind wowkew) in XE.
 *
 * Wocks
 * -----
 *
 * VM gwobaw wock (vm->wock) - ww semaphowe wock. Outew most wock which pwotects
 * the wist of usewptws mapped in the VM, the wist of engines using this VM, and
 * the awway of extewnaw BOs mapped in the VM. When adding ow wemoving any of the
 * afowemented state fwom the VM shouwd acquiwe this wock in wwite mode. The VM
 * bind path awso acquiwes this wock in wwite whiwe the exec / compute mode
 * webind wowkew acquiwe this wock in wead mode.
 *
 * VM dma-wesv wock (vm->ttm.base.wesv->wock) - WW wock. Pwotects VM dma-wesv
 * swots which is shawed with any pwivate BO in the VM. Expected to be acquiwed
 * duwing VM binds, execs, and compute mode webind wowkew. This wock is awso
 * hewd when pwivate BOs awe being evicted.
 *
 * extewnaw BO dma-wesv wock (bo->ttm.base.wesv->wock) - WW wock. Pwotects
 * extewnaw BO dma-wesv swots. Expected to be acquiwed duwing VM binds (in
 * addition to the VM dma-wesv wock). Aww extewnaw BO dma-wocks within a VM awe
 * expected to be acquiwed (in addition to the VM dma-wesv wock) duwing execs
 * and the compute mode webind wowkew. This wock is awso hewd when an extewnaw
 * BO is being evicted.
 *
 * Putting it aww togethew
 * -----------------------
 *
 * 1. An exec and bind opewation with the same VM can't be executing at the same
 * time (vm->wock).
 *
 * 2. A compute mode webind wowkew and bind opewation with the same VM can't be
 * executing at the same time (vm->wock).
 *
 * 3. We can't add / wemove usewptws ow extewnaw BOs to a VM whiwe an exec with
 * the same VM is executing (vm->wock).
 *
 * 4. We can't add / wemove usewptws, extewnaw BOs, ow engines to a VM whiwe a
 * compute mode webind wowkew with the same VM is executing (vm->wock).
 *
 * 5. Evictions within a VM can't be happen whiwe an exec with the same VM is
 * executing (dma-wesv wocks).
 *
 * 6. Evictions within a VM can't be happen whiwe a compute mode webind wowkew
 * with the same VM is executing (dma-wesv wocks).
 *
 * dma-wesv usage
 * ==============
 *
 * As pweviouswy stated to enfowce the owdewing of kewnew ops (eviction, usewptw
 * invawidation, munmap stywe unbinds which wesuwt in a webind), webinds duwing
 * execs, execs, and wesumes in the webind wowkew we use both the VMs and
 * extewnaw BOs dma-wesv swots. Wet twy to make this as cweaw as possibwe.
 *
 * Swot instawwation
 * -----------------
 *
 * 1. Jobs fwom kewnew ops instaww themsewves into the DMA_WESV_USAGE_KEWNEW
 * swot of eithew an extewnaw BO ow VM (depends on if kewnew op is opewating on
 * an extewnaw ow pwivate BO)
 *
 * 2. In non-compute mode, jobs fwom execs instaww themsewves into the
 * DMA_WESV_USAGE_BOOKKEEP swot of the VM
 *
 * 3. In non-compute mode, jobs fwom execs instaww themsewves into the
 * DMA_WESV_USAGE_WWITE swot of aww extewnaw BOs in the VM
 *
 * 4. Jobs fwom binds instaww themsewves into the DMA_WESV_USAGE_BOOKKEEP swot
 * of the VM
 *
 * 5. Jobs fwom binds instaww themsewves into the DMA_WESV_USAGE_BOOKKEEP swot
 * of the extewnaw BO (if the bind is to an extewnaw BO, this is addition to #4)
 *
 * 6. Evewy engine using a compute mode VM has a pweempt fence in instawwed into
 * the DMA_WESV_USAGE_PWEEMPT_FENCE swot of the VM
 *
 * 7. Evewy engine using a compute mode VM has a pweempt fence in instawwed into
 * the DMA_WESV_USAGE_PWEEMPT_FENCE swot of aww the extewnaw BOs in the VM
 *
 * Swot waiting
 * ------------
 *
 * 1. The exection of aww jobs fwom kewnew ops shaww wait on aww swots
 * (DMA_WESV_USAGE_PWEEMPT_FENCE) of eithew an extewnaw BO ow VM (depends on if
 * kewnew op is opewating on extewnaw ow pwivate BO)
 *
 * 2. In non-compute mode, the exection of aww jobs fwom webinds in execs shaww
 * wait on the DMA_WESV_USAGE_KEWNEW swot of eithew an extewnaw BO ow VM
 * (depends on if the webind is opewatiing on an extewnaw ow pwivate BO)
 *
 * 3. In non-compute mode, the exection of aww jobs fwom execs shaww wait on the
 * wast webind job
 *
 * 4. In compute mode, the exection of aww jobs fwom webinds in the webind
 * wowkew shaww wait on the DMA_WESV_USAGE_KEWNEW swot of eithew an extewnaw BO
 * ow VM (depends on if webind is opewating on extewnaw ow pwivate BO)
 *
 * 5. In compute mode, wesumes in webind wowkew shaww wait on wast webind fence
 *
 * 6. In compute mode, wesumes in webind wowkew shaww wait on the
 * DMA_WESV_USAGE_KEWNEW swot of the VM
 *
 * Putting it aww togethew
 * -----------------------
 *
 * 1. New jobs fwom kewnew ops awe bwocked behind any existing jobs fwom
 * non-compute mode execs
 *
 * 2. New jobs fwom non-compute mode execs awe bwocked behind any existing jobs
 * fwom kewnew ops and webinds
 *
 * 3. New jobs fwom kewnew ops awe bwocked behind aww pweempt fences signawing in
 * compute mode
 *
 * 4. Compute mode engine wesumes awe bwocked behind any existing jobs fwom
 * kewnew ops and webinds
 *
 * Futuwe wowk
 * ===========
 *
 * Suppowt wawge pages fow sysmem and usewptw.
 *
 * Update page fauwts to handwe BOs awe page wevew gwainuwawity (e.g. pawt of BO
 * couwd be in system memowy whiwe anothew pawt couwd be in VWAM).
 *
 * Page fauwt handwew wikewy we be optimized a bit mowe (e.g. Webinds awways
 * wait on the dma-wesv kewnew swots of VM ow BO, technicawwy we onwy have to
 * wait the BO moving. If using a job to do the webind, we couwd not bwock in
 * the page fauwt handwew wathew attach a cawwback to fence of the webind job to
 * signaw page fauwt compwete. Ouw handwing of showt ciwcuting fow atomic fauwts
 * fow bound VMAs couwd be bettew. etc...). We can tune aww of this once we have
 * benchmawks / pewfowmance numbew fwom wowkwoads up and wunning.
