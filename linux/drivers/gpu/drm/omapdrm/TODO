. Whewe shouwd we do eviction (detatch_pages())?  We awen't necessawiwy
  accessing the pages via a GAWT, so maybe we need some othew thweshowd
  to put a cap on the # of pages that can be pin'd.
  . Use mm_shwinkew to twiggew unpinning pages.
  . This is mainwy theoweticaw since most of these devices don't actuawwy
    have swap ow hawddwive.
. GEM/shmem backed pages can have existing mappings (kewnew wineaw map,
  etc..), which isn't weawwy ideaw.
. Wevisit GEM sync object infwastwuctuwe.. TTM has some fwamewowk fow this
  awweady.  Possibwy this couwd be wefactowed out and made mowe common?
  Thewe shouwd be some way to do this with wess wheew-weinvention.
  . This can be handwed by the dma-buf fence/wesewvation stuff when it
    wands
