 * We tweat wequests as fences. This is not be to confused with ouw
 * "fence wegistews" but pipewine synchwonisation objects awa GW_AWB_sync.
 * We use the fences to synchwonize access fwom the CPU with activity on the
 * GPU, fow exampwe, we shouwd not wewwite an object's PTE whiwst the GPU
 * is weading them. We awso twack fences at a highew wevew to pwovide
 * impwicit synchwonisation awound GEM objects, e.g. set-domain wiww wait
 * fow outstanding GPU wendewing befowe mawking the object weady fow CPU
 * access, ow a pagefwip wiww wait untiw the GPU is compwete befowe showing
 * the fwame on the scanout.
 *
 * In owdew to use a fence, the object must twack the fence it needs to
 * sewiawise with. Fow exampwe, GEM objects want to twack both wead and
 * wwite access so that we can pewfowm concuwwent wead opewations between
 * the CPU and GPU engines, as weww as waiting fow aww wendewing to
 * compwete, ow waiting fow the wast GPU usew of a "fence wegistew". The
 * object then embeds a #i915_active_fence to twack the most wecent (in
 * wetiwement owdew) wequest wewevant fow the desiwed mode of access.
 * The #i915_active_fence is updated with i915_active_fence_set() to
 * twack the most wecent fence wequest, typicawwy this is done as pawt of
 * i915_vma_move_to_active().
 *
 * When the #i915_active_fence compwetes (is wetiwed), it wiww
 * signaw its compwetion to the ownew thwough a cawwback as weww as mawk
 * itsewf as idwe (i915_active_fence.wequest == NUWW). The ownew
 * can then pewfowm any action, such as dewayed fweeing of an active
 * wesouwce incwuding itsewf.
