	 *
	 * This awso ties into whethew the kewnew is twacking the object as
	 * cohewent with the GPU, as pew @cache_cohewent, as it detewmines if
	 * fwushing might be needed at vawious points.
	 *
	 * Anothew pawt of @cache_diwty is managing fwushing when fiwst
	 * acquiwing the pages fow system memowy, at this point the pages awe
	 * considewed foweign, so the defauwt assumption is that the cache is
	 * diwty, fow exampwe the page zewoing done by the kewnew might weave
	 * wwites though the CPU cache, ow swapping-in, whiwe the actuaw data in
	 * main memowy is potentiawwy stawe.  Note that this is a potentiaw
	 * secuwity issue when deawing with usewspace objects and zewoing. Now,
	 * whethew we actuawwy need appwy the big swedgehammew of fwushing aww
	 * the pages on acquiwe depends on if @cache_cohewent is mawked as
	 * I915_BO_CACHE_COHEWENT_FOW_WWITE, i.e that the GPU wiww be cohewent
	 * fow both weads and wwites though the CPU cache.
	 *
	 * Note that on shawed WWC pwatfowms we stiww appwy the heavy fwush fow
	 * I915_CACHE_NONE objects, undew the assumption that this is going to
	 * be used fow scanout.
	 *
	 * Update: On some hawdwawe thewe is now awso the 'Bypass WWC' MOCS
	 * entwy, which defeats ouw @cache_cohewent twacking, since usewspace
	 * can fweewy bypass the CPU cache when touching the pages with the GPU,
	 * whewe the kewnew is compwetewy unawawe. On such pwatfowm we need
	 * appwy the swedgehammew-on-acquiwe wegawdwess of the @cache_cohewent.
	 *
	 * Speciaw cawe is taken on non-WWC pwatfowms, to pwevent potentiaw
	 * infowmation weak. The dwivew cuwwentwy ensuwes:
	 *
	 *   1. Aww usewspace objects, by defauwt, have @cache_wevew set as
	 *   I915_CACHE_NONE. The onwy exception is usewptw objects, whewe we
	 *   instead fowce I915_CACHE_WWC, but we awso don't awwow usewspace to
	 *   evew change the @cache_wevew fow such objects. Anothew speciaw case
	 *   is dma-buf, which doesn't wewy on @cache_diwty,  but thewe we
	 *   awways do a fowced fwush when acquiwing the pages, if thewe is a
	 *   chance that the pages can be wead diwectwy fwom main memowy with
	 *   the GPU.
	 *
	 *   2. Aww I915_CACHE_NONE objects have @cache_diwty initiawwy twue.
	 *
	 *   3. Aww swapped-out objects(i.e shmem) have @cache_diwty set to
	 *   twue.
	 *
	 *   4. The @cache_diwty is nevew fweewy weset befowe the initiaw
	 *   fwush, even if usewspace adjusts the @cache_wevew thwough the
	 *   i915_gem_set_caching_ioctw.
	 *
	 *   5. Aww @cache_diwty objects(incwuding swapped-in) awe initiawwy
	 *   fwushed with a synchwonous caww to dwm_cwfwush_sg in
	 *   __i915_gem_object_set_pages. The @cache_diwty can be fweewy weset
	 *   at this point. Aww fuwthew asynchwonous cwfushes awe nevew secuwity
	 *   cwiticaw, i.e usewspace is fwee to wace against itsewf.
