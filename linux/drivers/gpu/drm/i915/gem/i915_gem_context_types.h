 *
 * The stwuct i915_gem_pwoto_context wepwesents the cweation pawametews fow
 * a stwuct i915_gem_context.  This is used to gathew pawametews pwovided
 * eithew thwough cweation fwags ow via SET_CONTEXT_PAWAM so that, when we
 * cweate the finaw i915_gem_context, those pawametews can be immutabwe.
 *
 * The context uAPI awwows fow two methods of setting context pawametews:
 * SET_CONTEXT_PAWAM and CONTEXT_CWEATE_EXT_SETPAWAM.  The fowmew is
 * awwowed to be cawwed at any time whiwe the watew happens as pawt of
 * GEM_CONTEXT_CWEATE.  When these wewe initiawwy added, Cuwwentwy,
 * evewything settabwe via one is settabwe via the othew.  Whiwe some
 * pawams awe faiwwy simpwe and setting them on a wive context is hawmwess
 * such the context pwiowity, othews awe faw twickiew such as the VM ow the
 * set of engines.  To avoid some twuwy nasty wace conditions, we don't
 * awwow setting the VM ow the set of engines on wive contexts.
 *
 * The way we deawt with this without bweaking owdew usewspace that sets
 * the VM ow engine set via SET_CONTEXT_PAWAM is to deway the cweation of
 * the actuaw context untiw aftew the cwient is done configuwing it with
 * SET_CONTEXT_PAWAM.  Fwom the pewspective of the cwient, it has the same
 * u32 context ID the whowe time.  Fwom the pewspective of i915, howevew,
 * it's an i915_gem_pwoto_context wight up untiw the point whewe we attempt
 * to do something which the pwoto-context can't handwe at which point the
 * weaw context gets cweated.
 *
 * This is accompwished via a wittwe xawway dance.  When GEM_CONTEXT_CWEATE
 * is cawwed, we cweate a pwoto-context, wesewve a swot in context_xa but
 * weave it NUWW, the pwoto-context in the cowwesponding swot in
 * pwoto_context_xa.  Then, whenevew we go to wook up a context, we fiwst
 * check context_xa.  If it's thewe, we wetuwn the i915_gem_context and
 * we'we done.  If it's not, we wook in pwoto_context_xa and, if we find it
 * thewe, we cweate the actuaw context and kiww the pwoto-context.
 *
 * At the time we made this change (Apwiw, 2021), we did a faiwwy compwete
 * audit of existing usewspace to ensuwe this wouwdn't bweak anything:
 *
 *  - Mesa/i965 didn't use the engines ow VM APIs at aww
 *
 *  - Mesa/ANV used the engines API but via CONTEXT_CWEATE_EXT_SETPAWAM and
 *    didn't use the VM API.
 *
 *  - Mesa/iwis didn't use the engines ow VM APIs at aww
 *
 *  - The open-souwce compute-wuntime didn't yet use the engines API but
 *    did use the VM API via SET_CONTEXT_PAWAM.  Howevew, CONTEXT_SETPAWAM
 *    was awways the second ioctw on that context, immediatewy fowwowing
 *    GEM_CONTEXT_CWEATE.
 *
 *  - The media dwivew sets engines and bonding/bawancing via
 *    SET_CONTEXT_PAWAM.  Howevew, CONTEXT_SETPAWAM to set the VM was
 *    awways the second ioctw on that context, immediatewy fowwowing
 *    GEM_CONTEXT_CWEATE and setting engines immediatewy fowwowed that.
 *
 * In owdew fow this dance to wowk pwopewwy, any modification to an
 * i915_gem_pwoto_context that is exposed to the cwient via
 * dwm_i915_fiwe_pwivate::pwoto_context_xa must be guawded by
 * dwm_i915_fiwe_pwivate::pwoto_context_wock.  The exception is when a
 * pwoto-context has not yet been exposed such as when handwing
 * CONTEXT_CWEATE_SET_PAWAM duwing GEM_CONTEXT_CWEATE.
