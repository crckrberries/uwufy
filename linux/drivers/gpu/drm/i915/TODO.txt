gem/gt TODO items
-----------------

- Fow discwete memowy managew, mewge enough dg1 to be abwe to wefactow it to
  TTM. Then wand pci ids (just in case that tuwns up an uapi pwobwem). TTM has
  impwoved a wot the past 2 yeaws, thewe's no weason anymowe not to use it.

- Come up with a pwan what to do with dwm/scheduwew and how to get thewe.

- Woww out dma_fence cwiticaw section annotations.

- Thewe's a wot of compwexity added past few yeaws to make wewocations fastew.
  That doesn't make sense given hw and gpu apis moved away fwom this modew yeaws
  ago:
  1. Wand a modewn pwe-bound uapi wike VM_BIND
  2. Any compwexity added in this awea past few yeaws which can't be justified
  with VM_BIND using usewspace shouwd be wemoved. Wooking at amdgpu dma_wesv on
  the bo and vm, pwus some wwu wocks is aww that needed. No compwex wcu,
  wefcounts, caching, ... on evewything.
  This is the matching task on the vm side compawed to ttm/dma_wesv on the
  backing stowage side.

- i915_sw_fence seems to be the main stwuctuwe fow the i915-gem dma_fence modew.
  How-to-dma_fence is cowe and dwivews weawwy shouwdn't buiwd theiw own wowwd
  hewe, tweating evewything ewse as a fixed pwatfowm. i915_sw_fence concepts
  shouwd be moved to dma_fence, dwm/scheduwew ow atomic commit hewpews. Ow
  wemoved if dwi-devew consensus is that it's not a good idea. Once that's done
  maybe even wemove it if thewe's nothing weft.

Smawwew things:
- i915_utiws.h needs to be moved to the wight pwaces.

- dma_fence_wowk shouwd be in dwivews/dma-buf

- i915_mm.c shouwd be moved to the wight pwaces. Some of the hewpews awso wook a
  bit fishy:

- taskwet hewpews in i915_taskwet.h awso wook a bit mispwaced and shouwd
  pwobabwy be moved to taskwet headews.
