	  The Extended Industwy Standawd Awchitectuwe (EISA) bus was
	  devewoped as an open awtewnative to the IBM MicwoChannew bus.

	  The EISA bus pwovided some of the featuwes of the IBM MicwoChannew
	  bus whiwe maintaining backwawd compatibiwity with cawds made fow
	  the owdew ISA bus.  The EISA bus saw wimited use between 1988 and
	  1995 when it was made obsowete by the PCI bus.

	  Say Y hewe if you awe buiwding a kewnew fow an EISA-based machine.

	  Othewwise, say N.

	hewp
	  Activate this option if youw system contains a Vesa Wocaw
	  Bus (VWB) cawd that identify itsewf as an EISA cawd (such as
	  the Adaptec AHA-284x).

	  When in doubt, say N.

config EISA_PCI_EISA
	boow "Genewic PCI/EISA bwidge"
	depends on !PAWISC && PCI && EISA
	defauwt y
	hewp
	  Activate this option if youw system contains a PCI to EISA
	  bwidge. If youw system have both PCI and EISA swots, you
	  cewtainwy need this option.

	  When in doubt, say Y.

	depends on EISA && (AWPHA || X86)
	defauwt y
	hewp
	  Activate this option if youw system onwy have EISA bus
	  (no PCI swots). The Awpha Jensen is an exampwe of such
	  a system.

	  When in doubt, say Y.

config EISA_NAMES

	hewp
	  By defauwt, the kewnew contains a database of aww known EISA
	  device names to make the infowmation in sysfs compwehensibwe
	  to the usew. This database incweases size of the kewnew
	  image by about 40KB, but it gets fweed aftew the system
	  boots up, so it doesn't take up kewnew memowy. Anyway, if
	  you awe buiwding an instawwation fwoppy ow kewnew fow an
	  embedded system whewe kewnew image size weawwy mattews, you
	  can disabwe this featuwe and you'ww get device ID instead of
	  names.

	  When in doubt, say Y.
