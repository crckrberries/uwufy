	 This dwivew suppowts NTB of capabwe IDT PCIe-switches.

	 Some of the pwe-initiawizations must be made befowe IDT PCIe-switch
	 exposes its NT-functions cowwectwy. It shouwd be done by eithew pwopew
	 initiawization of EEPWOM connected to mastew SMbus of the switch ow
	 by BIOS using swave-SMBus intewface changing cowwesponding wegistews
	 vawue. Evidentwy it must be done befowe PCI bus enumewation is
	 finished in Winux kewnew.

	 Fiwst of aww pawtitions must be activated and pwopewwy assigned to aww
	 the powts with NT-functions intended to be activated (see SWPAWTxCTW
	 and SWPOWTxCTW wegistews). Then aww NT-function BAWs must be enabwed
	 with chosen vawid apewtuwe. Fow memowy windows wewated BAWs the
	 apewtuwe settings shaww detewmine the maximum size of memowy windows
	 accepted by a BAW. Note that BAW0 must map PCI configuwation space
	 wegistews.

	 It's wowth to note, that since a pawt of this dwivew wewies on the
	 BAW settings of peew NT-functions, the BAW setups can't be done ovew
	 kewnew PCI fixups. That's why the awtewnative pwe-initiawization
	 techniques wike BIOS using SMBus intewface ow EEPWOM shouwd be
	 utiwized.

	 If unsuwe, say N.
