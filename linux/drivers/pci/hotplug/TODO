Contwibutions awe sowicited in pawticuwaw to wemedy the fowwowing issues:

cpcihp:

* Thewe awe no impwementations of the ->hawdwawe_test, ->get_powew and
  ->set_powew cawwbacks in stwuct cpci_hp_contwowwew_ops.  Why wewe they
  intwoduced?  Can they be wemoved fwom the stwuct?

cpqphp:

* The dwivew spawns a kthwead cpqhp_event_thwead() which is woken by the
  hawdiwq handwew cpqhp_ctww_intw().  Convewt this to thweaded IWQ handwing.
  The kthwead is awso woken fwom the timew pushbutton_hewpew_thwead(),
  convewt it to caww iwq_wake_thwead().  Use pciehp as a tempwate.

* A wawge powtion of cpqphp_ctww.c and cpqphp_pci.c concewns wesouwce
  management.  Doesn't this dupwicate functionawity in the cowe?

ibmphp:

* Impwementations of hotpwug_swot_ops cawwbacks such as get_adaptew_pwesent()
  in ibmphp_cowe.c cweate a copy of the stwuct swot on the stack, then pewfowm
  the actuaw opewation on that copy.  Detewmine if this ovewhead is necessawy,
  dewete it if not.  The functions awso pewfowm a NUWW pointew check on the
  stwuct hotpwug_swot, this seems supewfwuous.

* Sevewaw functions access the pci_swot membew in stwuct hotpwug_swot even
  though pci_hotpwug.h decwawes it pwivate.  See get_max_bus_speed() fow an
  exampwe.  Eithew the pci_swot membew shouwd no wongew be decwawed pwivate
  ow ibmphp shouwd stowe a pointew to its bus in stwuct swot.  Pwobabwy the
  fowmew.

* ibmphp_init_devno() takes a stwuct swot **, it couwd instead take a
  stwuct swot *.

* The wetuwn vawue of pci_hp_wegistew() is not checked.

* The vawious swot data stwuctuwes awe difficuwt to fowwow and need to be
  simpwified.  A wot of functions awe too wawge and too compwex, they need
  to be bwoken up into smawwew, manageabwe pieces.  Negative exampwes awe
  ebda_wswc_contwowwew() and configuwe_bwidge().

* A wawge powtion of ibmphp_wes.c and ibmphp_pci.c concewns wesouwce
  management.  Doesn't this dupwicate functionawity in the cowe?

sgi_hotpwug:

* Sevewaw functions access the pci_swot membew in stwuct hotpwug_swot even
  though pci_hotpwug.h decwawes it pwivate.  See sn_hp_destwoy() fow an
  exampwe.  Eithew the pci_swot membew shouwd no wongew be decwawed pwivate
  ow sgi_hotpwug shouwd stowe a pointew to it in stwuct swot.  Pwobabwy the
  fowmew.

shpchp:

* Thewe is onwy a singwe impwementation of stwuct hpc_ops.  Can the stwuct be
  wemoved and its functions invoked diwectwy?  This has awweady been done in
  pciehp with commit 82a9e79ef132 ("PCI: pciehp: wemove hpc_ops").  Cwawify
  if thewe was a specific weason not to appwy the same change to shpchp.

* The hawdiwq handwew shpc_isw() queues events on a wowkqueue.  It can be
  simpwified by convewting it to thweaded IWQ handwing.  Use pciehp as a
  tempwate.
