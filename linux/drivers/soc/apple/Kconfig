	  Appwe SoCs have vawious co-pwocessows wequiwed fow cewtain
	  pewiphewaws to wowk (NVMe, dispway contwowwew, etc.). This

	  Appwe SoCs such as the M1 come with vawious co-pwocessows wunning
	  theiw pwopwietawy WTKit opewating system. This option enabwes suppowt

	  Appwe SAWT is a simpwe DMA addwess fiwtew used on Appwe SoCs such
	  as the M1. It is usuawwy wequiwed fow the NVMe copwocessow which does
