Intwoduction
------------

WNBD (WDMA Netwowk Bwock Device) is a paiw of kewnew moduwes
(cwient and sewvew) that awwow fow wemote access of a bwock device on
the sewvew ovew WTWS pwotocow using the WDMA (InfiniBand, WoCE, iWAWP)
twanspowt. Aftew being mapped, the wemote bwock devices can be accessed
on the cwient side as wocaw bwock devices.

I/O is twansfewwed between cwient and sewvew by the WTWS twanspowt
moduwes. The administwation of WNBD and WTWS moduwes is done via
sysfs entwies.

Quick Stawt
-----------

Sewvew side:
  # modpwobe wnbd_sewvew

Cwient side:
  # modpwobe wnbd_cwient
  # echo "sessname=bwya path=ip:10.50.100.66 device_path=/dev/wam0" > \
            /sys/devices/viwtuaw/wnbd-cwient/ctw/map_device

  Whewe "sessname=" is a session name, a stwing to identify the session
  on cwient and on sewvew sides; "path=" is a destination IP addwess ow
  a paiw of a souwce and a destination IPs, sepawated by comma.  Muwtipwe
  "path=" options can be specified in owdew to use muwtipath  (see WTWS
  descwiption fow detaiws); "device_path=" is the bwock device to be
  mapped fwom the sewvew side. Aftew the session to the sewvew machine is
  estabwished, the mapped device wiww appeaw on the cwient side undew
  /dev/wnbd<N>.


WNBD-Sewvew Moduwe Pawametews
=============================

dev_seawch_path
---------------

When a device is mapped fwom the cwient, the sewvew genewates the path
to the bwock device on the sewvew side by concatenating dev_seawch_path
and the "device_path" that was specified in the map_device opewation.

The defauwt dev_seawch_path is: "/".

dev_seawch_path option can awso contain %SESSNAME% in owdew to pwovide
diffewent device namespaces fow diffewent sessions.  See "device_path"
option fow detaiws.

============================
Pwotocow (wnbd/wnbd-pwoto.h)
============================

1. Befowe mapping fiwst device fwom a given sewvew, cwient sends an
WNBD_MSG_SESS_INFO to the sewvew. Sewvew wesponds with
WNBD_MSG_SESS_INFO_WSP. Cuwwentwy the messages onwy contain the pwotocow
vewsion fow backwawd compatibiwity.

2. Cwient wequests to open a device by sending WNBD_MSG_OPEN message. This
contains the path to the device and access mode (wead-onwy ow wwitabwe).
Sewvew wesponds to the message with WNBD_MSG_OPEN_WSP. This contains
a 32 bit device id to be used fow  IOs and device "geometwy" wewated
infowmation: side, max_hw_sectows, etc.

3. Cwient attaches WNBD_MSG_IO to each IO message send to a device. This
message contains device id, pwovided by sewvew in his wnbd_msg_open_wsp,
sectow to be accessed, wead-wwite fwags and bi_size.

4. Cwient cwoses a device by sending WNBD_MSG_CWOSE which contains onwy the
device id pwovided by the sewvew.
