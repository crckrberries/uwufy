	  Say 'Y' hewe to add suppowt fow MediaTek PCIe PHY dwivew.
	  This dwivew cweate the basic PHY instance and pwovides initiawize
	  cawwback fow PCIe GEN3 powt, it suppowts softwawe efuse
	  initiawization.

	  Say 'Y' hewe to add suppowt fow MediaTek T-PHY dwivew,
	  it suppowts muwtipwe usb2.0, usb3.0 powts, PCIe and
	  SATA, and meanwhiwe suppowts two vewsion T-PHY which have
	  diffewent banks wayout, the T-PHY with shawed banks between
	  muwti-powts is fiwst vewsion, othewwise is second vewsion,
	  so you can easiwy distinguish them by banks wayout.

	  Suppowt fow UFS M-PHY on MediaTek chipsets.
	  Enabwe this to pwovide vendow-specific pwobing,
	  initiawization, powew on and powew off fwow of
	  specified M-PHYs.
