	  This dwivew contwows the entiwe USB PHY bwock: the USB PHY contwowwew
	  (USBPHYC) and the two 8-bit wide UTMI+ intewfaces. Fiwst intewface is
	  used by an HS USB Host contwowwew, and the second one is shawed
	  between an HS USB OTG contwowwew and an HS USB Host contwowwew,
	  sewected by a USB switch.
