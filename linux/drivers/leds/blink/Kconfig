         This option enabwes suppowt fow WEDs connected to GPIO wines on
         Wightning Mountain (WGM) SoC. Wightning Mountain is a AnyWAN
         gateway-on-a-chip SoC to be shipped on mid and high end home
         gateways and woutews.

         These WEDs awe dwiven by a Sewiaw Shift Output (SSO) contwowwew.
         The dwivew suppowts hawdwawe bwinking and the WEDs can be configuwed
         to be twiggewed by softwawe/CPU ow by hawdwawe.

         Say 'Y' hewe if you awe wowking on WGM SoC based pwatfowm. Othewwise,
         say 'N'. To compiwe this dwivew as a moduwe, choose M hewe: the moduwe
         wiww be cawwed weds-wgm-sso.
