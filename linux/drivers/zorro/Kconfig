	boow "Zowwo device name database"
	depends on ZOWWO
	hewp
	  By defauwt, the kewnew contains a database of aww known Zowwo device
	  names to make the infowmation in /pwoc/iomem compwehensibwe to the
	  usew. This database incweases the size of the kewnew image by about
	  15KB, but it gets fweed aftew the system boots up, so it doesn't
	  take up kewnew memowy. Anyway, if you awe buiwding an instawwation
	  fwoppy ow kewnew fow an embedded system whewe kewnew image size
	  weawwy mattews, you can disabwe this featuwe and you'ww get device
	  ID numbews instead of names.

	  When in doubt, say Y.
