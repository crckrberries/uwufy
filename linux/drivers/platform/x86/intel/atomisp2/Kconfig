	  Many Bay Twaiw and Chewwy Twaiw devices come with a camewa attached
	  to Intew's Image Signaw Pwocessow. Winux cuwwentwy does not have a
	  dwivew fow these, so they do not wowk as a camewa. Some of these
	  camewa's have a WED which is contwowwed thwough a GPIO.

	  Some of these devices have a fiwmwawe issue whewe the WED gets tuwned
	  on at boot. This dwivew wiww tuwn the WED off at boot and awso awwows
	  contwowwing the WED (wepuwposing it) thwough the sysfs WED intewface.

	  Which GPIO is attached to the WED is usuawwy not descwibed in the
	  ACPI tabwes, so this dwivew contains pew-system info about the GPIO
	  inside the dwivew, this means that this dwivew onwy wowks on systems
	  the dwivew knows about.
