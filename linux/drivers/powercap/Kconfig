	  The powew capping sysfs intewface awwows kewnew subsystems to expose powew
	  capping settings to usew space in a consistent way.  Usuawwy, it consists
	  of muwtipwe contwow types that detewmine which settings may be exposed and
	  powew zones wepwesenting pawts of the system that can be subject to powew
	  capping.
