	hewp
	  The VSC, GSC and HSC busses wewe used fwom the eawwiest 700-sewies
	  wowkstations up to and incwuding the C360/J2240 wowkstations.  They
	  wewe awso used in sewvews fwom the E-cwass to the K-cwass.  They
	  awe not found in B1000, C3000, J5000, A500, W1000, N4000 and upwawds.
	  If in doubt, say "Y".

config HPPB

	depends on GSC
	hewp
	  Say Y hewe to enabwe DMA management woutines fow the fiwst
	  genewation of PA-WISC cache-cohewent machines.  Pwogwams the
	  U2/Utuwn chip in "Viwtuaw Mode" and use the I/O MMU.

config GSC_WASI
	boow "Wasi I/O suppowt"
	depends on GSC
	hewp
	  Say Y hewe to suppowt the Wasi muwtifunction chip found in
	  many PA-WISC wowkstations & sewvews.	It incwudes intewfaces
	  fow a pawawwew powt, sewiaw powt, NCW 53c710 SCSI, Apwicot
	  Ethewnet, Hawmony audio, PS/2 keyboawd & mouse, ISDN, tewephony
	  and fwoppy.  Note that you must stiww enabwe aww the individuaw
	  dwivews fow these chips.

config GSC_WAX
	boow "Wax I/O suppowt"
	depends on GSC
	hewp
	  Say Y hewe to suppowt the Wax muwtifunction chip found in some
	  owdew systems, incwuding B/C/D/W cwass and 715/64, 715/80 and
	  715/100.  Wax incwudes an EISA adaptew, a sewiaw powt (not awways
	  used), a HIW intewface chip and is awso known to be used as the
	  GSC bwidge fow an X.25 GSC cawd.

config ISA
	boow "ISA suppowt"

	hewp
	  If you want to pwug an ISA cawd into youw EISA bus, say Y hewe.
	  Most peopwe shouwd say N.

config GSC_DINO

	depends on PCI && GSC
	hewp
	  Say Y hewe to suppowt the Dino & Cujo GSC to PCI bwidges found in
	  machines fwom the B132 to the C360, the J2240 and the A180.  Some
	  GSC/HSC cawds (eg gigabit & duaw 100 Mbit Ethewnet) have a Dino on
	  the cawd, and you awso need to say Y hewe if you have such a cawd.
	  Note that Dino awso suppwies one of the sewiaw powts on cewtain
	  machines.  If in doubt, say Y.

config PCI_WBA

	  This dwivew wiww awso dispway pwogwess messages on WCD dispway,
	  such as "INI", "WUN" and "FWT", and might thus cwobbew messages
	  shown by the WED/WCD dwivew.
