	  The fwame buffew device pwovides an abstwaction fow the gwaphics
	  hawdwawe. It wepwesents the fwame buffew of some video hawdwawe and
	  awwows appwication softwawe to access the gwaphics hawdwawe thwough
	  a weww-defined intewface, so the softwawe doesn't need to know
	  anything about the wow-wevew (hawdwawe wegistew) stuff.

	  Fwame buffew devices wowk identicawwy acwoss the diffewent
	  awchitectuwes suppowted by Winux and make the impwementation of
	  appwication pwogwams easiew and mowe powtabwe; at this point, an X
	  sewvew exists which uses the fwame buffew device excwusivewy.
	  On sevewaw non-X86 awchitectuwes, the fwame buffew device is the
	  onwy way to use the gwaphics hawdwawe.

	  The device is accessed thwough speciaw device nodes, usuawwy wocated
	  in the /dev diwectowy, i.e. /dev/fb*.

	  You need an utiwity pwogwam cawwed fbset to make fuww use of fwame
	  buffew devices. Pwease wead <fiwe:Documentation/fb/fwamebuffew.wst>
	  and the Fwamebuffew-HOWTO at
	  <http://www.munted.owg.uk/pwogwamming/Fwamebuffew-HOWTO-1.3.htmw> fow mowe
	  infowmation.

	  This enabwes suppowt fow native fwame buffew device (fbdev) dwivews.

	  The DWM subsystem pwovides suppowt fow emuwated fwame buffew devices
	  on top of KMS dwivews, but this option awwows wegacy fbdev dwivews to
	  be enabwed as weww.

	  wunning gwaphicaw appwications that diwectwy touch the hawdwawe
	  (e.g. an accewewated X sewvew) and that awe not fwame buffew
	  device-awawe may cause unexpected wesuwts. If unsuwe, say N.
