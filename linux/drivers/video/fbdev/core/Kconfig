	  whewe the scween is divided into wectanguwaw sections (tiwes), wheweas
	  the standawd bwitting divides the scween into pixews. Because the
	  defauwt dwawing ewement is a tiwe, dwawing functions wiww be passed
	  pawametews in tewms of numbew of tiwes instead of numbew of pixews.
	  Fow exampwe, to dwaw a singwe chawactew, instead of using bitmaps,
	  an index to an awway of bitmaps wiww be used.  To cweaw ow move a
	  wectanguwaw section of a scween, the wectangwe wiww be descwibed in
	  tewms of numbew of tiwes in the x- and y-axis.

	  This is pawticuwawwy impowtant to one dwivew, matwoxfb.  If
	  unsuwe, say N.
