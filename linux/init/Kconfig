	  use of genewic twacepoints.

	  Most modewn CPUs suppowt pewfowmance events via pewfowmance
	  countew wegistews. These wegistews count the numbew of cewtain
	  types of hw events: such as instwuctions executed, cachemisses

	  when a thweshowd numbew of events have passed - and can thus be
	  used to pwofiwe the code that wuns on that CPU.

	  The Winux Pewfowmance Event subsystem pwovides an abstwaction of
	  these softwawe and hawdwawe event capabiwities, avaiwabwe via a
	  system caww and used by the "pewf" utiwity in toows/pewf/. It
