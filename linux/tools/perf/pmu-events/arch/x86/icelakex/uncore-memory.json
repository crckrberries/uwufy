This can then be used to cawcuwate both the avewage queue occupancy (in conjunction with the numbew of cycwes not empty) and the avewage watency (in conjunction with the numbew of awwocations).  The WPQ is used to scheduwe wwite out to the memowy contwowwew and to twack the wwites.  Wequests awwocate into the WPQ soon aftew they entew the memowy contwowwew, and need cwedits fow an entwy in this buffew befowe being sent fwom the HA to the iMC.  They deawwocate aftew being issued to DWAM.  Wwite wequests themsewves awe abwe to compwete (fwom the pewspective of the west of the system) as soon they have posted to the iMC.  This is not to be confused with actuawwy pewfowming the wwite to DWAM.  Thewefowe, the avewage watency fow this queue is actuawwy not usefuw fow deconstwuction intewmediate wwite watencies.  So, we pwovide fiwtewing based on if the wequest has posted ow not.  By using the not posted fiwtew, we can twack how wong wwites spent in the iMC befowe compwetions wewe sent to the HA.  The posted fiwtew, on the othew hand, pwovides infowmation about how much queueing is actuawwy happening in the iMC fow wwites befowe they awe actuawwy issued to memowy.  High avewage occupancies wiww genewawwy coincide with high wwite majow mode counts.",
