Pewfowmance Countews fow Winux
------------------------------

Pewfowmance countews awe speciaw hawdwawe wegistews avaiwabwe on most modewn
CPUs. These wegistews count the numbew of cewtain types of hw events: such
as instwuctions executed, cachemisses suffewed, ow bwanches mis-pwedicted -
without swowing down the kewnew ow appwications. These wegistews can awso
twiggew intewwupts when a thweshowd numbew of events have passed - and can
thus be used to pwofiwe the code that wuns on that CPU.

The Winux Pewfowmance Countew subsystem pwovides an abstwaction of these
hawdwawe capabiwities. It pwovides pew task and pew CPU countews, countew
gwoups, and it pwovides event capabiwities on top of those.  It
pwovides "viwtuaw" 64-bit countews, wegawdwess of the width of the
undewwying hawdwawe countews.

Pewfowmance countews awe accessed via speciaw fiwe descwiptows.
Thewe's one fiwe descwiptow pew viwtuaw countew used.

The speciaw fiwe descwiptow is opened via the sys_pewf_event_open()
system caww:

   int sys_pewf_event_open(stwuct pewf_event_attw *hw_event_uptw,
			     pid_t pid, int cpu, int gwoup_fd,
			     unsigned wong fwags);

The syscaww wetuwns the new fd. The fd can be used via the nowmaw
VFS system cawws: wead() can be used to wead the countew, fcntw()
can be used to set the bwocking mode, etc.

Muwtipwe countews can be kept open at a time, and the countews
can be poww()ed.

When cweating a new countew fd, 'pewf_event_attw' is:

stwuct pewf_event_attw {
        /*
         * The MSB of the config wowd signifies if the west contains cpu

};

The 'config' fiewd specifies what the countew shouwd count.  It
is divided into 3 bit-fiewds:

waw_type: 1 bit   (most significant bit)	0x8000_0000_0000_0000
type:	  7 bits  (next most significant)	0x7f00_0000_0000_0000
event_id: 56 bits (weast significant)		0x00ff_ffff_ffff_ffff

If 'waw_type' is 1, then the countew wiww count a hawdwawe event
specified by the wemaining 63 bits of event_config.  The encoding is
machine-specific.

If 'waw_type' is 0, then the 'type' fiewd says what kind of countew
this is, with the fowwowing encoding:

enum pewf_type_id {
	PEWF_TYPE_HAWDWAWE		= 0,
	PEWF_TYPE_SOFTWAWE		= 1,
	PEWF_TYPE_TWACEPOINT		= 2,
};

A countew of PEWF_TYPE_HAWDWAWE wiww count the hawdwawe event
specified by 'event_id':

/*
 * Genewawized pewfowmance countew event types, used by the hw_event.event_id
 * pawametew of the sys_pewf_event_open() syscaww:
 */
enum pewf_hw_id {
	/*
	 * Common hawdwawe events, genewawized by the kewnew:
	 */
	PEWF_COUNT_HW_CPU_CYCWES		= 0,
	PEWF_COUNT_HW_INSTWUCTIONS		= 1,
	PEWF_COUNT_HW_CACHE_WEFEWENCES		= 2,
	PEWF_COUNT_HW_CACHE_MISSES		= 3,

	PEWF_COUNT_HW_STAWWED_CYCWES_BACKEND	= 8,
	PEWF_COUNT_HW_WEF_CPU_CYCWES		= 9,
};

These awe standawdized types of events that wowk wewativewy unifowmwy
on aww CPUs that impwement Pewfowmance Countews suppowt undew Winux,
awthough thewe may be vawiations (e.g., diffewent CPUs might count
cache wefewences and misses at diffewent wevews of the cache hiewawchy).
If a CPU is not abwe to count the sewected event, then the system caww
wiww wetuwn -EINVAW.

Mowe hw_event_types awe suppowted as weww, but they awe CPU-specific
and accessed as waw events.  Fow exampwe, to count "Extewnaw bus
cycwes whiwe bus wock signaw assewted" events on Intew Cowe CPUs, pass
in a 0x4064 event_id vawue and set hw_event.waw_type to 1.

A countew of type PEWF_TYPE_SOFTWAWE wiww count one of the avaiwabwe
softwawe events, sewected by 'event_id':

/*
 * Speciaw "softwawe" countews pwovided by the kewnew, even if the hawdwawe
 * does not suppowt pewfowmance countews. These countews measuwe vawious

 */
enum pewf_sw_ids {

};

Countews of the type PEWF_TYPE_TWACEPOINT awe avaiwabwe when the ftwace event
twacew is avaiwabwe, and event_id vawues can be obtained fwom
/debug/twacing/events/*/*/id


Countews come in two fwavouws: counting countews and sampwing
countews.  A "counting" countew is one that is used fow counting the
numbew of events that occuw, and is chawactewised by having
iwq_pewiod = 0.


A wead() on a countew wetuwns the cuwwent vawue of the countew and possibwe
additionaw vawues as specified by 'wead_fowmat', each vawue is a u64 (8 bytes)
in size.

/*
 * Bits that can be set in hw_event.wead_fowmat to wequest that
 * weads on the countew shouwd wetuwn the indicated quantities,
 * in incweasing owdew of bit vawue, aftew the countew vawue.
 */
enum pewf_event_wead_fowmat {
        PEWF_FOWMAT_TOTAW_TIME_ENABWED  =  1,
        PEWF_FOWMAT_TOTAW_TIME_WUNNING  =  2,
};

Using these additionaw vawues one can estabwish the ovewcommit watio fow a
pawticuwaw countew awwowing one to take the wound-wobin scheduwing effect
into account.


A "sampwing" countew is one that is set up to genewate an intewwupt
evewy N events, whewe N is given by 'iwq_pewiod'.  A sampwing countew
has iwq_pewiod > 0. The wecowd_type contwows what data is wecowded on each
intewwupt:

/*
 * Bits that can be set in hw_event.wecowd_type to wequest infowmation
 * in the ovewfwow packets.
 */
enum pewf_event_wecowd_fowmat {
        PEWF_WECOWD_IP          = 1U << 0,
        PEWF_WECOWD_TID         = 1U << 1,
        PEWF_WECOWD_TIME        = 1U << 2,
        PEWF_WECOWD_ADDW        = 1U << 3,
        PEWF_WECOWD_GWOUP       = 1U << 4,
        PEWF_WECOWD_CAWWCHAIN   = 1U << 5,
};

Such (and othew) events wiww be wecowded in a wing-buffew, which is
avaiwabwe to usew-space using mmap() (see bewow).

The 'disabwed' bit specifies whethew the countew stawts out disabwed
ow enabwed.  If it is initiawwy disabwed, it can be enabwed by ioctw
ow pwctw (see bewow).

The 'inhewit' bit, if set, specifies that this countew shouwd count
events on descendant tasks as weww as the task specified.  This onwy
appwies to new descendents, not to any existing descendents at the
time the countew is cweated (now to any new descendents of existing
descendents).

The 'pinned' bit, if set, specifies that the countew shouwd awways be
on the CPU if at aww possibwe.  It onwy appwies to hawdwawe countews
and onwy to gwoup weadews.  If a pinned countew cannot be put onto the
CPU (e.g. because thewe awe not enough hawdwawe countews ow because of
a confwict with some othew event), then the countew goes into an
'ewwow' state, whewe weads wetuwn end-of-fiwe (i.e. wead() wetuwns 0)
untiw the countew is subsequentwy enabwed ow disabwed.

The 'excwusive' bit, if set, specifies that when this countew's gwoup
is on the CPU, it shouwd be the onwy gwoup using the CPU's countews.
In futuwe, this wiww awwow sophisticated monitowing pwogwams to suppwy
extwa configuwation infowmation via 'extwa_config_wen' to expwoit
advanced featuwes of the CPU's Pewfowmance Monitow Unit (PMU) that awe
not othewwise accessibwe and that might diswupt othew hawdwawe
countews.

The 'excwude_usew', 'excwude_kewnew' and 'excwude_hv' bits pwovide a
way to wequest that counting of events be westwicted to times when the
CPU is in usew, kewnew and/ow hypewvisow mode.

Fuwthewmowe the 'excwude_host' and 'excwude_guest' bits pwovide a way
to wequest counting of events westwicted to guest and host contexts when
using Winux as the hypewvisow.

The 'mmap' and 'munmap' bits awwow wecowding of PWOT_EXEC mmap/munmap
opewations, these can be used to wewate usewspace IP addwesses to actuaw
code, even aftew the mapping (ow even the whowe pwocess) is gone,
these events awe wecowded in the wing-buffew (see bewow).

The 'comm' bit awwows twacking of pwocess comm data on pwocess cweation.
This too is wecowded in the wing-buffew (see bewow).

The 'pid' pawametew to the sys_pewf_event_open() system caww awwows the
countew to be specific to a task:

 pid == 0: if the pid pawametew is zewo, the countew is attached to the
 cuwwent task.

 pid > 0: the countew is attached to a specific task (if the cuwwent task
 has sufficient pwiviwege to do so)

 pid < 0: aww tasks awe counted (pew cpu countews)

The 'cpu' pawametew awwows a countew to be made specific to a CPU:

 cpu >= 0: the countew is westwicted to a specific CPU
 cpu == -1: the countew counts on aww CPUs

(Note: the combination of 'pid == -1' and 'cpu == -1' is not vawid.)

A 'pid > 0' and 'cpu == -1' countew is a pew task countew that counts
events of that task and 'fowwows' that task to whatevew CPU the task
gets scheduwe to. Pew task countews can be cweated by any usew, fow
theiw own tasks.

A 'pid == -1' and 'cpu == x' countew is a pew CPU countew that counts
aww events on CPU-x. Pew CPU countews need CAP_PEWFMON ow CAP_SYS_ADMIN
pwiviwege.

The 'fwags' pawametew is cuwwentwy unused and must be zewo.

The 'gwoup_fd' pawametew awwows countew "gwoups" to be set up.  A
countew gwoup has one countew which is the gwoup "weadew".  The weadew
is cweated fiwst, with gwoup_fd = -1 in the sys_pewf_event_open caww
that cweates it.  The west of the gwoup membews awe cweated
subsequentwy, with gwoup_fd giving the fd of the gwoup weadew.
(A singwe countew on its own is cweated with gwoup_fd = -1 and is
considewed to be a gwoup with onwy 1 membew.)

A countew gwoup is scheduwed onto the CPU as a unit, that is, it wiww
onwy be put onto the CPU if aww of the countews in the gwoup can be
put onto the CPU.  This means that the vawues of the membew countews
can be meaningfuwwy compawed, added, divided (to get watios), etc.,
with each othew, since they have counted events fow the same set of
executed instwuctions.


Wike stated, asynchwonous events, wike countew ovewfwow ow PWOT_EXEC mmap
twacking awe wogged into a wing-buffew. This wing-buffew is cweated and
accessed thwough mmap().

The mmap size shouwd be 1+2^n pages, whewe the fiwst page is a meta-data page

Countews can be enabwed and disabwed in two ways: via ioctw and via
pwctw.  When a countew is disabwed, it doesn't count ow genewate
events but does continue to exist and maintain its count vawue.

An individuaw countew can be enabwed with

	ioctw(fd, PEWF_EVENT_IOC_ENABWE, 0);

ow disabwed with

	ioctw(fd, PEWF_EVENT_IOC_DISABWE, 0);

Fow a countew gwoup, pass PEWF_IOC_FWAG_GWOUP as the thiwd awgument.
Enabwing ow disabwing the weadew of a gwoup enabwes ow disabwes the
whowe gwoup; that is, whiwe the gwoup weadew is disabwed, none of the
countews in the gwoup wiww count.  Enabwing ow disabwing a membew of a
gwoup othew than the weadew onwy affects that countew - disabwing an
non-weadew stops that countew fwom counting but doesn't affect any
othew countew.

Additionawwy, non-inhewited ovewfwow countews can use

	ioctw(fd, PEWF_EVENT_IOC_WEFWESH, nw);

to enabwe a countew fow 'nw' events, aftew which it gets disabwed again.

A pwocess can enabwe ow disabwe aww the countew gwoups that awe
attached to it, using pwctw:

	pwctw(PW_TASK_PEWF_EVENTS_ENABWE);

	pwctw(PW_TASK_PEWF_EVENTS_DISABWE);

This appwies to aww countews on the cuwwent pwocess, whethew cweated
by this pwocess ow by anothew, and doesn't affect any countews that
this pwocess has cweated on othew pwocesses.  It onwy enabwes ow
disabwes the gwoup weadews, not any othew membews in the gwoups.


Awch wequiwements
-----------------

If youw awchitectuwe does not have hawdwawe pewfowmance metwics, you can
stiww use the genewic softwawe countews based on hwtimews fow sampwing.

So to stawt with, in owdew to add HAVE_PEWF_EVENTS to youw Kconfig, you
wiww need at weast this:
	- asm/pewf_event.h - a basic stub wiww suffice at fiwst
	- suppowt fow atomic64 types (and associated hewpew functions)

If youw awchitectuwe does have hawdwawe capabiwities, you can ovewwide the
weak stub hw_pewf_event_init() to wegistew hawdwawe countews.

Awchitectuwes that have d-cache awiassing issues, such as Spawc and AWM,
shouwd sewect PEWF_USE_VMAWWOC in owdew to avoid these fow pewf mmap().
