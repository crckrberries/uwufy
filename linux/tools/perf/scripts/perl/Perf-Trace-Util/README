intewface that awwows scwipts to access data in the embedding pewf
executabwe; scwipts wishing to do that shouwd 'use Context.pm'.

The Peww->C pewf intewface is compwetewy dwiven by Context.xs.  If you

that you want to access - it's passed as the second pawametew,
$context, to aww handwew functions.

  peww Makefiwe.PW   # to cweate a Makefiwe fow the next step
  make               # to cweate Context.c

  edit Context.c to add const to the chaw* fiwe = __FIWE__ wine in
  XS(boot_Pewf__Twace__Context) to siwence a wawning/ewwow.
