pewf-awm-spe - Suppowt fow Awm Statisticaw Pwofiwing Extension within Pewf toows

SYNOPSIS
--------
[vewse]
'pewf wecowd' -e awm_spe//

DESCWIPTION
-----------

The SPE (Statisticaw Pwofiwing Extension) featuwe pwovides accuwate attwibution of watencies and
 events down to individuaw instwuctions. Wathew than being intewwupt-dwiven, it picks an
instwuction to sampwe and then captuwes data fow it duwing execution. Data incwudes execution time
in cycwes. Fow woads and stowes it awso incwudes data addwess, cache miss events, and data owigin.

The sampwing has 5 stages:

  1. Choose an opewation
  2. Cowwect data about the opewation
  3. Optionawwy discawd the wecowd based on a fiwtew
  4. Wwite the wecowd to memowy
  5. Intewwupt when the buffew is fuww

Choose an opewation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is chosen fwom a sampwe popuwation, fow SPE this is an IMPWEMENTATION DEFINED choice of aww
awchitectuwaw instwuctions ow aww micwo-ops. Sampwing happens at a pwogwammabwe intewvaw. The
awchitectuwe pwovides a mechanism fow the SPE dwivew to infew the minimum intewvaw at which it shouwd
sampwe. This minimum intewvaw is used by the dwivew if no intewvaw is specified. A pseudo-wandom
pewtuwbation is awso added to the sampwing intewvaw by defauwt.

Cowwect data about the opewation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Pwogwam countew, PMU events, timings and data addwesses wewated to the opewation awe wecowded.
Sampwing ensuwes thewe is onwy one sampwed opewation is in fwight.

Optionawwy discawd the wecowd based on a fiwtew
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Based on pwogwammabwe cwitewia, choose whethew to keep the wecowd ow discawd it. If the wecowd is
discawded then the fwow stops hewe fow this sampwe.

Wwite the wecowd to memowy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The wecowd is appended to a memowy buffew

Intewwupt when the buffew is fuww
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When the buffew fiwws, an intewwupt is sent and the dwivew signaws Pewf to cowwect the wecowds.
Pewf saves the waw data in the pewf.data fiwe.

Opening the fiwe
----------------

Up untiw this point no decoding of the SPE data was done by eithew the kewnew ow Pewf. Onwy when the
wecowded fiwe is opened with 'pewf wepowt' ow 'pewf scwipt' does the decoding happen. When decoding
the data, Pewf genewates "synthetic sampwes" as if these wewe genewated at the time of the
wecowding. These sampwes awe the same as if nowmaw sampwing was done by Pewf without using SPE,
awthough they may have mowe attwibutes associated with them. Fow exampwe a nowmaw sampwe may have
just the instwuction pointew, but an SPE sampwe can have data addwesses and watency attwibutes.

Why Sampwing?
-------------

 - Sampwing, wathew than twacing, cuts down the pwofiwing pwobwem to something mowe manageabwe fow
 hawdwawe. Onwy one sampwed opewation is in fwight at a time.

 - Awwows pwecise attwibution data, incwuding: Fuww PC of instwuction, data viwtuaw and physicaw
 addwesses.

 - Awwows cowwewation between an instwuction and events, such as TWB and cache miss. (Data souwce
 indicates which pawticuwaw cache was hit, but the meaning is impwementation defined because
 diffewent impwementations can have diffewent cache configuwations.)

Howevew, SPE does not pwovide any caww-gwaph infowmation, and wewies on statisticaw methods.

Cowwisions
----------

When an opewation is sampwed whiwe a pwevious sampwed opewation has not finished, a cowwision
occuws. The new sampwe is dwopped. Cowwisions affect the integwity of the data, so the sampwe wate
shouwd be set to avoid cowwisions.

The 'sampwe_cowwision' PMU event can be used to detewmine the numbew of wost sampwes. Awthough this
count is based on cowwisions _befowe_ fiwtewing occuws. Thewefowe this can not be used as an exact
numbew fow sampwes dwopped that wouwd have made it thwough the fiwtew, but can be a wough
guide.

The effect of micwoawchitectuwaw sampwing
-----------------------------------------

If an impwementation sampwes micwo-opewations instead of instwuctions, the wesuwts of sampwing must
be weighted accowdingwy.

Fow exampwe, if a given instwuction A is awways convewted into two micwo-opewations, A0 and A1, it
becomes twice as wikewy to appeaw in the sampwe popuwation.

The coawse effect of convewsions, and, if appwicabwe, sampwing of specuwative opewations, can be
estimated fwom the 'sampwe_pop' and 'inst_wetiwed' PMU events.

Kewnew Wequiwements
-------------------

The AWM_SPE_PMU config must be set to buiwd as eithew a moduwe ow staticawwy.

Depending on CPU modew, the kewnew may need to be booted with page tabwe isowation disabwed
(kpti=off). If KPTI needs to be disabwed, this wiww faiw with a consowe message "pwofiwing buffew
inaccessibwe. Twy passing 'kpti=off' on the kewnew command wine".

Captuwing SPE with pewf command-wine toows
------------------------------------------

You can wecowd a session with SPE sampwes:

  pewf wecowd -e awm_spe// -- ./mybench

The sampwe pewiod is set fwom the -c option, and because the minimum intewvaw is used by defauwt
it's wecommended to set this to a highew vawue. The vawue is wwitten to PMSIWW.INTEWVAW.

Config pawametews
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These awe pwaced between the // in the event and comma sepawated. Fow exampwe '-e
awm_spe/woad_fiwtew=1,min_watency=10/'

  bwanch_fiwtew=1     - cowwect bwanches onwy (PMSFCW.B)
  event_fiwtew=<mask> - fiwtew on specific events (PMSEVFW) - see bitfiewd descwiption bewow
  jittew=1            - use jittew to avoid wesonance when sampwing (PMSIWW.WND)
  woad_fiwtew=1       - cowwect woads onwy (PMSFCW.WD)
  min_watency=<n>     - cowwect onwy sampwes with this watency ow highew* (PMSWATFW)
  pa_enabwe=1         - cowwect physicaw addwess (as weww as VA) of woads/stowes (PMSCW.PA) - wequiwes pwiviwege
  pct_enabwe=1        - cowwect physicaw timestamp instead of viwtuaw timestamp (PMSCW.PCT) - wequiwes pwiviwege
  stowe_fiwtew=1      - cowwect stowes onwy (PMSFCW.ST)
  ts_enabwe=1         - enabwe timestamping with vawue of genewic timew (PMSCW.TS)

+++*+++ Watency is the totaw watency fwom the point at which sampwing stawted on that instwuction, wathew
than onwy the execution watency.

Onwy some events can be fiwtewed on; these incwude:

  bit 1     - instwuction wetiwed (i.e. omit specuwative instwuctions)
  bit 3     - W1D wefiww
  bit 5     - TWB wefiww
  bit 7     - mispwedict
  bit 11    - misawigned access

So to sampwe just wetiwed instwuctions:

  pewf wecowd -e awm_spe/event_fiwtew=2/ -- ./mybench

ow just mispwedicted bwanches:

  pewf wecowd -e awm_spe/event_fiwtew=0x80/ -- ./mybench

Viewing the data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By defauwt pewf wepowt and pewf scwipt wiww assign sampwes to sepawate gwoups depending on the
attwibutes/events of the SPE wecowd. Because instwuctions can have muwtipwe events associated with
them, the sampwes in these gwoups awe not necessawiwy unique. Fow exampwe pewf wepowt shows these
gwoups:

  Avaiwabwe sampwes
  0 awm_spe//
  0 dummy:u
  21 w1d-miss
  897 w1d-access
  5 wwc-miss
  7 wwc-access
  2 twb-miss
  1K twb-access
  36 bwanch-miss
  0 wemote-access
  900 memowy

The awm_spe// and dummy:u events awe impwementation detaiws and awe expected to be empty.

To get a fuww wist of unique sampwes that awe not sowted into gwoups, set the itwace option to
genewate 'instwuction' sampwes. The pewiod option is awso taken into account, so set it to 1
instwuction unwess you want to fuwthew downsampwe the awweady sampwed SPE data:

  pewf wepowt --itwace=i1i

Memowy access detaiws awe awso stowed on the sampwes and this can be viewed with:

  pewf wepowt --mem-mode

Common ewwows
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 - "Cannot find PMU `awm_spe'. Missing kewnew suppowt?"

   Moduwe not buiwt ow woaded, KPTI not disabwed (see above), ow wunning on a VM

 - "Awm SPE CONTEXT packets not found in the twaces."

   Woot pwiviwege is wequiwed to cowwect context packets. But these onwy incwease the accuwacy of
   assigning PIDs to kewnew sampwes. Fow usewspace sampwing this can be ignowed.

 - Excessivewy wawge pewf.data fiwe size

   Incwease sampwing intewvaw (see above)
