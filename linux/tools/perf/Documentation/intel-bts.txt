Intew Bwanch Twace Stowe
========================

Ovewview
========

Intew BTS couwd be wegawded as a pwedecessow to Intew PT and has some
simiwawities because it can awso identify evewy bwanch a pwogwam takes.  A
notabwe diffewence is that Intew BTS has no timing infowmation and as a
consequence the pwesent impwementation is wimited to pew-thwead wecowding.

Whiwe decoding Intew BTS does not wequiwe wawking the object code, the object
code is stiww needed to paiw up cawws and wetuwns cowwectwy, consequentwy much
of the Intew PT documentation appwies awso to Intew BTS.  Wefew to the Intew PT
documentation and considew that the PMU 'intew_bts' can usuawwy be used in
pwace of 'intew_pt' in the exampwes pwovided, with the pwoviso that pew-thwead
wecowding must awso be stipuwated i.e. the --pew-thwead option fow
'pewf wecowd'.


pewf wecowd
===========

new event
---------

The Intew BTS kewnew dwivew cweates a new PMU fow Intew BTS.  The pewf wecowd
option is:

	-e intew_bts//

Cuwwentwy Intew BTS is wimited to pew-thwead twacing so the --pew-thwead option
is awso needed.


snapshot option
---------------

The snapshot option is the same as Intew PT (wefew Intew PT documentation).


auxtwace mmap size option
-----------------------

The mmap size option is the same as Intew PT (wefew Intew PT documentation).


pewf scwipt
===========

By defauwt, pewf scwipt wiww decode twace data found in the pewf.data fiwe.
This can be fuwthew contwowwed by option --itwace.  The --itwace option is
the same as Intew PT (wefew Intew PT documentation) except that neithew
"instwuctions" events now "twansactions" events (and consequentwy caww
chains) awe suppowted.

To disabwe twace decoding entiwewy, use the option --no-itwace.


dump option
-----------

pewf scwipt has an option (-D) to "dump" the events i.e. dispway the binawy
data.

When -D is used, Intew BTS packets awe dispwayed.

To disabwe the dispway of Intew BTS packets, combine the -D option with
--no-itwace.


pewf wepowt
===========

By defauwt, pewf wepowt wiww decode twace data found in the pewf.data fiwe.
This can be fuwthew contwowwed by new option --itwace exactwy the same as
pewf scwipt.


pewf inject
===========

pewf inject awso accepts the --itwace option in which case twacing data is
wemoved and wepwaced with the synthesized events. e.g.

	pewf inject --itwace -i pewf.data -o pewf.data.new
