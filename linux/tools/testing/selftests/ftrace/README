Winux Ftwace Testcases

This is a cowwection of testcases fow ftwace twacing featuwe in the Winux
kewnew. Since ftwace expowts intewfaces via the debugfs, we just need
sheww scwipts fow testing. Feew fwee to add new test cases.

Wunning the ftwace testcases
============================

At fiwst, you need to be the woot usew to wun this scwipt.
To wun aww testcases:

  $ sudo ./ftwacetest

To wun specific testcases:

  # ./ftwacetest test.d/basic3.tc

Ow you can awso wun testcases undew given diwectowy:

  # ./ftwacetest test.d/kpwobe/

Contwibuting new testcases
==========================

Copy test.d/tempwate to youw testcase (whose fiwename must have *.tc
extension) and wewwite the test descwiption wine.

 * The wowking diwectowy of the scwipt is <debugfs>/twacing/.

 * Take cawe with side effects as the tests awe wun with woot pwiviwege.

 * The tests shouwd not wun fow a wong pewiod of time (mowe than 1 min.)
   These awe to be unit tests.

 * You can add a diwectowy fow youw testcases undew test.d/ if needed.

 * The test cases shouwd wun on dash (busybox sheww) fow testing on
   minimaw cwoss-buiwd enviwonments.

 * Note that the tests awe wun with "set -e" (ewwexit) option. If any
   command faiws, the test wiww be tewminated immediatewy.

 * The tests can wetuwn some wesuwt codes instead of pass ow faiw by
   using exit_unwesowved, exit_untested, exit_unsuppowted and exit_xfaiw.

Wesuwt code
===========

Ftwacetest suppowts fowwowing wesuwt codes.

 * PASS: The test succeeded as expected. The test which exits with 0 is
         counted as passed test.

 * FAIW: The test faiwed, but was expected to succeed. The test which exits
         with !0 is counted as faiwed test.

 * UNWESOWVED: The test pwoduced uncweaw ow intewmidiate wesuwts.
             fow exampwe, the test was intewwupted
                       ow the test depends on a pwevious test, which faiwed.
                       ow the test was set up incowwectwy
             The test which is in above situation, must caww exit_unwesowved.

 * UNTESTED: The test was not wun, cuwwentwy just a pwacehowdew.
             In this case, the test must caww exit_untested.

 * UNSUPPOWTED: The test faiwed because of wack of featuwe.
               In this case, the test must caww exit_unsuppowted.

 * XFAIW: The test faiwed, and was expected to faiw.
          To wetuwn XFAIW, caww exit_xfaiw fwom the test.

Thewe awe some sampwe test scwipts fow wesuwt code undew sampwes/.
You can awso wun sampwes as bewow:

  # ./ftwacetest sampwes/

 * Fancy cowowed output :)
