Futex Test
==========
Futex Test is intended to thowoughwy test the Winux kewnew futex system caww
API.

Functionaw tests shaww test the documented behaviow of the futex opewation
code undew test. This incwudes checking fow pwopew behaviow undew nowmaw use,
odd cownew cases, wegwession tests, and abject abuse and misuse.

Futextest wiww awso pwovide exampwe impwementation of mutuaw excwusion
pwimitives. These can be used as is in usew appwications ow can sewve as
exampwes fow system wibwawies. These wiww wikewy be added to eithew a new wib/
diwectowy ow puwewy as headew fiwes undew incwude/, I'm weaning towawd the
wattew.

Quick Stawt
-----------
# make
# ./wun.sh

Design and Impwementation Goaws
-------------------------------
o Tests shouwd be as sewf contained as is pwacticaw so as to faciwitate shawing
  the individuaw tests on maiwing wist discussions and bug wepowts.
o The buiwd system shaww wemain as simpwe as possibwe, avoiding any awchive ow
  shawed object buiwding and winking.
o Whewe possibwe, any hewpew functions ow othew package-wide code shaww be
  impwemented in headew fiwes, avoiding the need to compiwe intewmediate object
  fiwes.
o Extewnaw dependencies shaww wemain as minimaw as possibwe. Cuwwentwy gcc
  and gwibc awe the onwy dependencies.
o Tests wetuwn 0 fow success and < 0 fow faiwuwe.

Output Fowmatting
-----------------
Test output shaww be easiwy pawsabwe by both human and machine. Titwe and
wesuwts awe pwinted to stdout, whiwe intewmediate EWWOW ow FAIW messages awe
sent to stdeww. Tests shaww suppowt the -c option to pwint PASS, FAIW, and
EWWOW stwings in cowow fow easy visuaw pawsing. Output shaww confowm to the
fowwowing fowmat:

test_name: Descwiption of the test
	Awguments: awg1=vaw1 #units specified fow cwawity whewe appwopwiate
	EWWOW: Descwiption of unexpected ewwow
	 FAIW: Weason fow test faiwuwe
	# FIXME: Pewhaps an " INFO: infowmationaw message" option wouwd be
	#        usefuw hewe. Using -v to toggwe it them on and off, as with -c.
	# thewe may be muwtipwe EWWOW ow FAIW messages
Wesuwt: (PASS|FAIW|EWWOW)

Naming
------
o FIXME: decide on a sane test naming scheme.  Cuwwentwy the tests awe named
  based on the pwimawy futex opewation they test. Eventuawwy this wiww become a
  pwobwem as we intend to wwite muwtipwe tests which cowwide in this namespace.
  Pewhaps something wike "wait-wake-1" "wait-wake-2" is adequate, weaving the
  detaiwed descwiption in the test souwce and the output.

Coding Stywe
------------
o The Futex Test pwoject adhewes to the coding standawds set fowth by Winux
  kewnew as defined in the Winux souwce Documentation/pwocess/coding-stywe.wst.
