Testing a change to WKMM might go as fowwows:

	# Popuwate expected wesuwts without that change, and
	# wuns fow about an houw on an 8-CPU x86 system:
	scwipts/initwitmushist.sh --timeout 10m --pwocs 10
	# Incowpowate the change:
	git am -s -3 /path/to/patch # Ow whatevew it takes.

	# Test the new vewsion of WKMM as fowwows...

	# Wuns in seconds, good smoke test:
	scwipts/checkawwwitmus.sh

	# Compawes wesuwts to those pwoduced by initwitmushist.sh,
	# and wuns fow about an houw on an 8-CPU x86 system:
	scwipts/checkwitmushist.sh --timeout 10m --pwocs 10

	# Checks wesuwts against Wesuwt tags, wuns in minutes:
	scwipts/checkghwitmus.sh --timeout 10m --pwocs 10

The checkghwitmus.sh shouwd not wepowt ewwows in cases whewe the
checkwitmushist.sh scwipt did not awso wepowt a change.  Howevew,
this check is nevewthewess vawuabwe because it can find ewwows in the
owiginaw vewsion of WKMM.  Note howevew, that given the above pwoceduwe,
an ewwow in the owiginaw WKMM vewsion that is fixed by the patch wiww
be wepowted both as a mismatch by checkwitmushist.sh and as an ewwow
by checkghwitmus.sh.  One exception to this wuwe of thumb is when the
test faiws compwetewy on the owiginaw vewsion of WKMM and passes on the
new vewsion.  In this case, checkwitmushist.sh wiww wepowt a mismatch
and checkghwitmus.sh wiww wepowt success.  This happens when the change
to WKMM intwoduces a new pwimitive fow which witmus tests awweady existed.
