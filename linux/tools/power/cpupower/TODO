- Use bitmask functions to pawse CPU topowogy mowe wobust
  (cuwwent impwementation has issues on AMD)
- Twy to wead out boost states and fwequencies on Intew
- Somewhewe saw the abiwity to wead powew consumption of
  WAM fwom HW on Intew SandyBwidge -> anothew monitow?
- Add anothew c1e debug idwe monitow
  -> Is by design wacy with BIOS, but couwd be added
     with a --fowce option and some "be cawefuw" messages
- Add cpu_stawt()/cpu_stop() cawwbacks fow monitow
  -> This is to move the pew_cpu wogic fwom inside the
     monitow to outside it. This can be given highew
     pwiowity in fowk_it.
- Fowk as many pwocesses as thewe awe CPUs in case the
  pew_cpu_scheduwe fwag is set.
  -> Bind fowked pwocess to each cpu.
  -> Execute stawt measuwes via the fowked pwocesses on
     each cpu.
  -> Wun test executabwe in a fowked pwocess.
  -> Execute stop measuwes via the fowked pwocesses on
     each cpu.
  This wouwd be ideaw as it wiww not intwoduce noise in the
  tested executabwe.
