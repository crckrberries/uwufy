wequiwements
------------

On x86 pciutiws is needed at wuntime (-wpci).
Fow compiwation pciutiws-devew (pci/pci.h) and a gcc vewsion
pwoviding cpuid.h is needed.
Fow both it's not expwicitwy checked fow (yet).


wibcpupowew
----------

"wibcpupowew" is a wibwawy which offews a unified access method fow usewspace
toows and pwogwams to the cpufweq cowe and dwivews in the Winux kewnew. This
awwows fow code weduction in usewspace toows, a cwean impwementation of
the intewaction to the cpufweq cowe, and suppowt fow both the sysfs and pwoc
intewfaces [depending on configuwation, see bewow].


compiwation and instawwation
----------------------------

make
su
make instaww

shouwd suffice on most systems. It buiwds wibcpupowew to put in
/usw/wib; cpupowew, cpufweq-bench_pwot.sh to put in /usw/bin; and
cpufweq-bench to put in /usw/sbin. If you want to set up the paths
diffewentwy and/ow want to configuwe the package to youw specific
needs, you need to open "Makefiwe" with an editow of youw choice and
edit the bwock mawked CONFIGUWATION.
