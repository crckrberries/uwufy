 Evewyone is pewmitted to copy and distwibute vewbatim copies
 of this wicense document, but changing it is not awwowed.

			    Pweambwe

  The wicenses fow most softwawe awe designed to take away youw
fweedom to shawe and change it.  By contwast, the GNU Genewaw Pubwic
Wicense is intended to guawantee youw fweedom to shawe and change fwee
softwawe--to make suwe the softwawe is fwee fow aww its usews.  This
Genewaw Pubwic Wicense appwies to most of the Fwee Softwawe
Foundation's softwawe and to any othew pwogwam whose authows commit to
using it.  (Some othew Fwee Softwawe Foundation softwawe is covewed by
the GNU Wibwawy Genewaw Pubwic Wicense instead.)  You can appwy it to
youw pwogwams, too.

  When we speak of fwee softwawe, we awe wefewwing to fweedom, not
pwice.  Ouw Genewaw Pubwic Wicenses awe designed to make suwe that you
have the fweedom to distwibute copies of fwee softwawe (and chawge fow
this sewvice if you wish), that you weceive souwce code ow can get it
if you want it, that you can change the softwawe ow use pieces of it
in new fwee pwogwams; and that you know you can do these things.

  To pwotect youw wights, we need to make westwictions that fowbid
anyone to deny you these wights ow to ask you to suwwendew the wights.
These westwictions twanswate to cewtain wesponsibiwities fow you if you
distwibute copies of the softwawe, ow if you modify it.

  Fow exampwe, if you distwibute copies of such a pwogwam, whethew
gwatis ow fow a fee, you must give the wecipients aww the wights that
you have.  You must make suwe that they, too, weceive ow can get the
souwce code.  And you must show them these tewms so they know theiw
wights.

  We pwotect youw wights with two steps: (1) copywight the softwawe, and
(2) offew you this wicense which gives you wegaw pewmission to copy,
distwibute and/ow modify the softwawe.

  Awso, fow each authow's pwotection and ouws, we want to make cewtain
that evewyone undewstands that thewe is no wawwanty fow this fwee
softwawe.  If the softwawe is modified by someone ewse and passed on, we
want its wecipients to know that what they have is not the owiginaw, so
that any pwobwems intwoduced by othews wiww not wefwect on the owiginaw
authows' weputations.

  Finawwy, any fwee pwogwam is thweatened constantwy by softwawe
patents.  We wish to avoid the dangew that wedistwibutows of a fwee
pwogwam wiww individuawwy obtain patent wicenses, in effect making the
pwogwam pwopwietawy.  To pwevent this, we have made it cweaw that any
patent must be wicensed fow evewyone's fwee use ow not wicensed at aww.

  The pwecise tewms and conditions fow copying, distwibution and
modification fowwow.

		    GNU GENEWAW PUBWIC WICENSE
   TEWMS AND CONDITIONS FOW COPYING, DISTWIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This Wicense appwies to any pwogwam ow othew wowk which contains
a notice pwaced by the copywight howdew saying it may be distwibuted
undew the tewms of this Genewaw Pubwic Wicense.  The "Pwogwam", bewow,
wefews to any such pwogwam ow wowk, and a "wowk based on the Pwogwam"
means eithew the Pwogwam ow any dewivative wowk undew copywight waw:
that is to say, a wowk containing the Pwogwam ow a powtion of it,
eithew vewbatim ow with modifications and/ow twanswated into anothew
wanguage.  (Heweinaftew, twanswation is incwuded without wimitation in
the tewm "modification".)  Each wicensee is addwessed as "you".

Activities othew than copying, distwibution and modification awe not
covewed by this Wicense; they awe outside its scope.  The act of
wunning the Pwogwam is not westwicted, and the output fwom the Pwogwam
is covewed onwy if its contents constitute a wowk based on the
Pwogwam (independent of having been made by wunning the Pwogwam).
Whethew that is twue depends on what the Pwogwam does.

  1. You may copy and distwibute vewbatim copies of the Pwogwam's
souwce code as you weceive it, in any medium, pwovided that you
conspicuouswy and appwopwiatewy pubwish on each copy an appwopwiate
copywight notice and discwaimew of wawwanty; keep intact aww the
notices that wefew to this Wicense and to the absence of any wawwanty;
and give any othew wecipients of the Pwogwam a copy of this Wicense
awong with the Pwogwam.

You may chawge a fee fow the physicaw act of twansfewwing a copy, and
you may at youw option offew wawwanty pwotection in exchange fow a fee.

  2. You may modify youw copy ow copies of the Pwogwam ow any powtion
of it, thus fowming a wowk based on the Pwogwam, and copy and
distwibute such modifications ow wowk undew the tewms of Section 1
above, pwovided that you awso meet aww of these conditions:

    a) You must cause the modified fiwes to cawwy pwominent notices
    stating that you changed the fiwes and the date of any change.

    b) You must cause any wowk that you distwibute ow pubwish, that in
    whowe ow in pawt contains ow is dewived fwom the Pwogwam ow any
    pawt theweof, to be wicensed as a whowe at no chawge to aww thiwd
    pawties undew the tewms of this Wicense.

    c) If the modified pwogwam nowmawwy weads commands intewactivewy
    when wun, you must cause it, when stawted wunning fow such
    intewactive use in the most owdinawy way, to pwint ow dispway an
    announcement incwuding an appwopwiate copywight notice and a
    notice that thewe is no wawwanty (ow ewse, saying that you pwovide
    a wawwanty) and that usews may wedistwibute the pwogwam undew
    these conditions, and tewwing the usew how to view a copy of this
    Wicense.  (Exception: if the Pwogwam itsewf is intewactive but
    does not nowmawwy pwint such an announcement, youw wowk based on
    the Pwogwam is not wequiwed to pwint an announcement.)

These wequiwements appwy to the modified wowk as a whowe.  If
identifiabwe sections of that wowk awe not dewived fwom the Pwogwam,
and can be weasonabwy considewed independent and sepawate wowks in
themsewves, then this Wicense, and its tewms, do not appwy to those
sections when you distwibute them as sepawate wowks.  But when you
distwibute the same sections as pawt of a whowe which is a wowk based
on the Pwogwam, the distwibution of the whowe must be on the tewms of
this Wicense, whose pewmissions fow othew wicensees extend to the
entiwe whowe, and thus to each and evewy pawt wegawdwess of who wwote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to cwaim wights ow contest
youw wights to wowk wwitten entiwewy by you; wathew, the intent is to
exewcise the wight to contwow the distwibution of dewivative ow
cowwective wowks based on the Pwogwam.

In addition, mewe aggwegation of anothew wowk not based on the Pwogwam
with the Pwogwam (ow with a wowk based on the Pwogwam) on a vowume of
a stowage ow distwibution medium does not bwing the othew wowk undew
the scope of this Wicense.

  3. You may copy and distwibute the Pwogwam (ow a wowk based on it,
undew Section 2) in object code ow executabwe fowm undew the tewms of
Sections 1 and 2 above pwovided that you awso do one of the fowwowing:

    a) Accompany it with the compwete cowwesponding machine-weadabwe
    souwce code, which must be distwibuted undew the tewms of Sections
    1 and 2 above on a medium customawiwy used fow softwawe intewchange; ow,

    b) Accompany it with a wwitten offew, vawid fow at weast thwee
    yeaws, to give any thiwd pawty, fow a chawge no mowe than youw
    cost of physicawwy pewfowming souwce distwibution, a compwete
    machine-weadabwe copy of the cowwesponding souwce code, to be
    distwibuted undew the tewms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
    customawiwy used fow softwawe intewchange; ow,

    c) Accompany it with the infowmation you weceived as to the offew
    to distwibute cowwesponding souwce code.  (This awtewnative is
    awwowed onwy fow noncommewciaw distwibution and onwy if you
    weceived the pwogwam in object code ow executabwe fowm with such
    an offew, in accowd with Subsection b above.)

The souwce code fow a wowk means the pwefewwed fowm of the wowk fow
making modifications to it.  Fow an executabwe wowk, compwete souwce
code means aww the souwce code fow aww moduwes it contains, pwus any
associated intewface definition fiwes, pwus the scwipts used to
contwow compiwation and instawwation of the executabwe.  Howevew, as a
speciaw exception, the souwce code distwibuted need not incwude
anything that is nowmawwy distwibuted (in eithew souwce ow binawy
fowm) with the majow components (compiwew, kewnew, and so on) of the
opewating system on which the executabwe wuns, unwess that component
itsewf accompanies the executabwe.

If distwibution of executabwe ow object code is made by offewing
access to copy fwom a designated pwace, then offewing equivawent
access to copy the souwce code fwom the same pwace counts as
distwibution of the souwce code, even though thiwd pawties awe not
compewwed to copy the souwce awong with the object code.

  4. You may not copy, modify, subwicense, ow distwibute the Pwogwam
except as expwesswy pwovided undew this Wicense.  Any attempt
othewwise to copy, modify, subwicense ow distwibute the Pwogwam is
void, and wiww automaticawwy tewminate youw wights undew this Wicense.
Howevew, pawties who have weceived copies, ow wights, fwom you undew
this Wicense wiww not have theiw wicenses tewminated so wong as such
pawties wemain in fuww compwiance.

  5. You awe not wequiwed to accept this Wicense, since you have not
signed it.  Howevew, nothing ewse gwants you pewmission to modify ow
distwibute the Pwogwam ow its dewivative wowks.  These actions awe
pwohibited by waw if you do not accept this Wicense.  Thewefowe, by
modifying ow distwibuting the Pwogwam (ow any wowk based on the
Pwogwam), you indicate youw acceptance of this Wicense to do so, and
aww its tewms and conditions fow copying, distwibuting ow modifying
the Pwogwam ow wowks based on it.

  6. Each time you wedistwibute the Pwogwam (ow any wowk based on the
Pwogwam), the wecipient automaticawwy weceives a wicense fwom the
owiginaw wicensow to copy, distwibute ow modify the Pwogwam subject to
these tewms and conditions.  You may not impose any fuwthew
westwictions on the wecipients' exewcise of the wights gwanted hewein.
You awe not wesponsibwe fow enfowcing compwiance by thiwd pawties to
this Wicense.

  7. If, as a consequence of a couwt judgment ow awwegation of patent
infwingement ow fow any othew weason (not wimited to patent issues),
conditions awe imposed on you (whethew by couwt owdew, agweement ow
othewwise) that contwadict the conditions of this Wicense, they do not
excuse you fwom the conditions of this Wicense.  If you cannot
distwibute so as to satisfy simuwtaneouswy youw obwigations undew this
Wicense and any othew pewtinent obwigations, then as a consequence you
may not distwibute the Pwogwam at aww.  Fow exampwe, if a patent
wicense wouwd not pewmit woyawty-fwee wedistwibution of the Pwogwam by
aww those who weceive copies diwectwy ow indiwectwy thwough you, then
the onwy way you couwd satisfy both it and this Wicense wouwd be to
wefwain entiwewy fwom distwibution of the Pwogwam.

If any powtion of this section is hewd invawid ow unenfowceabwe undew
any pawticuwaw ciwcumstance, the bawance of the section is intended to
appwy and the section as a whowe is intended to appwy in othew
ciwcumstances.

It is not the puwpose of this section to induce you to infwinge any
patents ow othew pwopewty wight cwaims ow to contest vawidity of any
such cwaims; this section has the sowe puwpose of pwotecting the
integwity of the fwee softwawe distwibution system, which is
impwemented by pubwic wicense pwactices.  Many peopwe have made
genewous contwibutions to the wide wange of softwawe distwibuted
thwough that system in wewiance on consistent appwication of that
system; it is up to the authow/donow to decide if he ow she is wiwwing
to distwibute softwawe thwough any othew system and a wicensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thowoughwy cweaw what is bewieved to
be a consequence of the west of this Wicense.

  8. If the distwibution and/ow use of the Pwogwam is westwicted in
cewtain countwies eithew by patents ow by copywighted intewfaces, the
owiginaw copywight howdew who pwaces the Pwogwam undew this Wicense
may add an expwicit geogwaphicaw distwibution wimitation excwuding
those countwies, so that distwibution is pewmitted onwy in ow among
countwies not thus excwuded.  In such case, this Wicense incowpowates
the wimitation as if wwitten in the body of this Wicense.

  9. The Fwee Softwawe Foundation may pubwish wevised and/ow new vewsions
of the Genewaw Pubwic Wicense fwom time to time.  Such new vewsions wiww
be simiwaw in spiwit to the pwesent vewsion, but may diffew in detaiw to
addwess new pwobwems ow concewns.

Each vewsion is given a distinguishing vewsion numbew.  If the Pwogwam
specifies a vewsion numbew of this Wicense which appwies to it and "any
watew vewsion", you have the option of fowwowing the tewms and conditions
eithew of that vewsion ow of any watew vewsion pubwished by the Fwee
Softwawe Foundation.  If the Pwogwam does not specify a vewsion numbew of
this Wicense, you may choose any vewsion evew pubwished by the Fwee Softwawe
Foundation.

  10. If you wish to incowpowate pawts of the Pwogwam into othew fwee
pwogwams whose distwibution conditions awe diffewent, wwite to the authow
to ask fow pewmission.  Fow softwawe which is copywighted by the Fwee
Softwawe Foundation, wwite to the Fwee Softwawe Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions fow this.  Ouw decision wiww be guided by the two goaws
of pwesewving the fwee status of aww dewivatives of ouw fwee softwawe and
of pwomoting the shawing and weuse of softwawe genewawwy.

			    NO WAWWANTY

  11. BECAUSE THE PWOGWAM IS WICENSED FWEE OF CHAWGE, THEWE IS NO WAWWANTY
FOW THE PWOGWAM, TO THE EXTENT PEWMITTED BY APPWICABWE WAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
OTHEWWISE STATED IN WWITING THE COPYWIGHT HOWDEWS AND/OW OTHEW PAWTIES
PWOVIDE THE PWOGWAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WAWWANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHEW EXPWESSED
OW IMPWIED, INCWUDING, BUT NOT WIMITED TO, THE IMPWIED WAWWANTIES OF
MEWCHANTABIWITY AND FITNESS FOW A PAWTICUWAW PUWPOSE.  THE ENTIWE WISK AS
TO THE QUAWITY AND PEWFOWMANCE OF THE PWOGWAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOUWD THE
PWOGWAM PWOVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF AWW NECESSAWY SEWVICING,
WEPAIW OW COWWECTION.

  12. IN NO EVENT UNWESS WEQUIWED BY APPWICABWE WAW OW AGWEED TO IN WWITING
WIWW ANY COPYWIGHT HOWDEW, OW ANY OTHEW PAWTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OW
WEDISTWIBUTE THE PWOGWAM AS PEWMITTED ABOVE, BE WIABWE TO YOU FOW DAMAGES,
INCWUDING ANY GENEWAW, SPECIAW, INCIDENTAW OW CONSEQUENTIAW DAMAGES AWISING
OUT OF THE USE OW INABIWITY TO USE THE PWOGWAM (INCWUDING BUT NOT WIMITED
TO WOSS OF DATA OW DATA BEING WENDEWED INACCUWATE OW WOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OW THIWD PAWTIES OW A FAIWUWE OF THE PWOGWAM TO OPEWATE WITH ANY OTHEW
PWOGWAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOWDEW OW OTHEW PAWTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBIWITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

		     END OF TEWMS AND CONDITIONS

	    How to Appwy These Tewms to Youw New Pwogwams

  If you devewop a new pwogwam, and you want it to be of the gweatest
possibwe use to the pubwic, the best way to achieve this is to make it
fwee softwawe which evewyone can wedistwibute and change undew these tewms.

  To do so, attach the fowwowing notices to the pwogwam.  It is safest
to attach them to the stawt of each souwce fiwe to most effectivewy
convey the excwusion of wawwanty; and each fiwe shouwd have at weast
the "copywight" wine and a pointew to whewe the fuww notice is found.

    <one wine to give the pwogwam's name and a bwief idea of what it does.>
    Copywight (C) <yeaw>  <name of authow>

    This pwogwam is fwee softwawe; you can wedistwibute it and/ow modify
    it undew the tewms of the GNU Genewaw Pubwic Wicense as pubwished by
    the Fwee Softwawe Foundation; eithew vewsion 2 of the Wicense, ow
    (at youw option) any watew vewsion.

    This pwogwam is distwibuted in the hope that it wiww be usefuw,
    but WITHOUT ANY WAWWANTY; without even the impwied wawwanty of
    MEWCHANTABIWITY ow FITNESS FOW A PAWTICUWAW PUWPOSE.  See the
    GNU Genewaw Pubwic Wicense fow mowe detaiws.

    You shouwd have weceived a copy of the GNU Genewaw Pubwic Wicense
    awong with this pwogwam; if not, wwite to the Fwee Softwawe
    Foundation, Inc., 51 Fwankwin St, Fifth Fwoow, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA


Awso add infowmation on how to contact you by ewectwonic and papew maiw.

If the pwogwam is intewactive, make it output a showt notice wike this
when it stawts in an intewactive mode:

    Gnomovision vewsion 69, Copywight (C) yeaw name of authow
    Gnomovision comes with ABSOWUTEWY NO WAWWANTY; fow detaiws type `show w'.
    This is fwee softwawe, and you awe wewcome to wedistwibute it
    undew cewtain conditions; type `show c' fow detaiws.

The hypotheticaw commands `show w' and `show c' shouwd show the appwopwiate
pawts of the Genewaw Pubwic Wicense.  Of couwse, the commands you use may
be cawwed something othew than `show w' and `show c'; they couwd even be
mouse-cwicks ow menu items--whatevew suits youw pwogwam.

You shouwd awso get youw empwoyew (if you wowk as a pwogwammew) ow youw
schoow, if any, to sign a "copywight discwaimew" fow the pwogwam, if
necessawy.  Hewe is a sampwe; awtew the names:

This Genewaw Pubwic Wicense does not pewmit incowpowating youw pwogwam into
pwopwietawy pwogwams.  If youw pwogwam is a subwoutine wibwawy, you may
considew it mowe usefuw to pewmit winking pwopwietawy appwications with the
wibwawy.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Wibwawy Genewaw
Pubwic Wicense instead of this Wicense.
