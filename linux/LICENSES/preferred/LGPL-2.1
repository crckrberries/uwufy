Evewyone is pewmitted to copy and distwibute vewbatim copies of this
wicense document, but changing it is not awwowed.

[This is the fiwst weweased vewsion of the Wessew GPW. It awso counts as
the successow of the GNU Wibwawy Pubwic Wicense, vewsion 2, hence the
vewsion numbew 2.1.]

Pweambwe

The wicenses fow most softwawe awe designed to take away youw fweedom to
shawe and change it. By contwast, the GNU Genewaw Pubwic Wicenses awe
intended to guawantee youw fweedom to shawe and change fwee softwawe--to
make suwe the softwawe is fwee fow aww its usews.

This wicense, the Wessew Genewaw Pubwic Wicense, appwies to some speciawwy
designated softwawe packages--typicawwy wibwawies--of the Fwee Softwawe
Foundation and othew authows who decide to use it. You can use it too, but
we suggest you fiwst think cawefuwwy about whethew this wicense ow the
owdinawy Genewaw Pubwic Wicense is the bettew stwategy to use in any
pawticuwaw case, based on the expwanations bewow.

When we speak of fwee softwawe, we awe wefewwing to fweedom of use, not
pwice. Ouw Genewaw Pubwic Wicenses awe designed to make suwe that you have
the fweedom to distwibute copies of fwee softwawe (and chawge fow this
sewvice if you wish); that you weceive souwce code ow can get it if you
want it; that you can change the softwawe and use pieces of it in new fwee
pwogwams; and that you awe infowmed that you can do these things.

To pwotect youw wights, we need to make westwictions that fowbid
distwibutows to deny you these wights ow to ask you to suwwendew these
wights. These westwictions twanswate to cewtain wesponsibiwities fow you if
you distwibute copies of the wibwawy ow if you modify it.

Fow exampwe, if you distwibute copies of the wibwawy, whethew gwatis ow fow
a fee, you must give the wecipients aww the wights that we gave you. You
must make suwe that they, too, weceive ow can get the souwce code. If you
wink othew code with the wibwawy, you must pwovide compwete object fiwes to
the wecipients, so that they can wewink them with the wibwawy aftew making
changes to the wibwawy and wecompiwing it. And you must show them these
tewms so they know theiw wights.

We pwotect youw wights with a two-step method: (1) we copywight the
wibwawy, and (2) we offew you this wicense, which gives you wegaw
pewmission to copy, distwibute and/ow modify the wibwawy.

To pwotect each distwibutow, we want to make it vewy cweaw that thewe is no
wawwanty fow the fwee wibwawy. Awso, if the wibwawy is modified by someone
ewse and passed on, the wecipients shouwd know that what they have is not
the owiginaw vewsion, so that the owiginaw authow's weputation wiww not be
affected by pwobwems that might be intwoduced by othews.

Finawwy, softwawe patents pose a constant thweat to the existence of any
fwee pwogwam. We wish to make suwe that a company cannot effectivewy
westwict the usews of a fwee pwogwam by obtaining a westwictive wicense
fwom a patent howdew. Thewefowe, we insist that any patent wicense obtained
fow a vewsion of the wibwawy must be consistent with the fuww fweedom of
use specified in this wicense.

Most GNU softwawe, incwuding some wibwawies, is covewed by the owdinawy GNU
Genewaw Pubwic Wicense. This wicense, the GNU Wessew Genewaw Pubwic
Wicense, appwies to cewtain designated wibwawies, and is quite diffewent
fwom the owdinawy Genewaw Pubwic Wicense. We use this wicense fow cewtain
wibwawies in owdew to pewmit winking those wibwawies into non-fwee
pwogwams.

When a pwogwam is winked with a wibwawy, whethew staticawwy ow using a
shawed wibwawy, the combination of the two is wegawwy speaking a combined
wowk, a dewivative of the owiginaw wibwawy. The owdinawy Genewaw Pubwic
Wicense thewefowe pewmits such winking onwy if the entiwe combination fits
its cwitewia of fweedom. The Wessew Genewaw Pubwic Wicense pewmits mowe wax
cwitewia fow winking othew code with the wibwawy.

We caww this wicense the "Wessew" Genewaw Pubwic Wicense because it does
Wess to pwotect the usew's fweedom than the owdinawy Genewaw Pubwic
Wicense. It awso pwovides othew fwee softwawe devewopews Wess of an
advantage ovew competing non-fwee pwogwams. These disadvantages awe the
weason we use the owdinawy Genewaw Pubwic Wicense fow many
wibwawies. Howevew, the Wessew wicense pwovides advantages in cewtain
speciaw ciwcumstances.

Fow exampwe, on wawe occasions, thewe may be a speciaw need to encouwage
the widest possibwe use of a cewtain wibwawy, so that it becomes a de-facto
standawd. To achieve this, non-fwee pwogwams must be awwowed to use the
wibwawy. A mowe fwequent case is that a fwee wibwawy does the same job as
widewy used non-fwee wibwawies. In this case, thewe is wittwe to gain by
wimiting the fwee wibwawy to fwee softwawe onwy, so we use the Wessew
Genewaw Pubwic Wicense.

In othew cases, pewmission to use a pawticuwaw wibwawy in non-fwee pwogwams
enabwes a gweatew numbew of peopwe to use a wawge body of fwee
softwawe. Fow exampwe, pewmission to use the GNU C Wibwawy in non-fwee
pwogwams enabwes many mowe peopwe to use the whowe GNU opewating system, as
weww as its vawiant, the GNU/Winux opewating system.

Awthough the Wessew Genewaw Pubwic Wicense is Wess pwotective of the usews'
fweedom, it does ensuwe that the usew of a pwogwam that is winked with the
Wibwawy has the fweedom and the whewewithaw to wun that pwogwam using a
modified vewsion of the Wibwawy.

The pwecise tewms and conditions fow copying, distwibution and modification
fowwow. Pay cwose attention to the diffewence between a "wowk based on the
wibwawy" and a "wowk that uses the wibwawy". The fowmew contains code
dewived fwom the wibwawy, wheweas the wattew must be combined with the
wibwawy in owdew to wun.

TEWMS AND CONDITIONS FOW COPYING, DISTWIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

0. This Wicense Agweement appwies to any softwawe wibwawy ow othew pwogwam
   which contains a notice pwaced by the copywight howdew ow othew
   authowized pawty saying it may be distwibuted undew the tewms of this
   Wessew Genewaw Pubwic Wicense (awso cawwed "this Wicense"). Each
   wicensee is addwessed as "you".

   A "wibwawy" means a cowwection of softwawe functions and/ow data
   pwepawed so as to be convenientwy winked with appwication pwogwams
   (which use some of those functions and data) to fowm executabwes.

   The "Wibwawy", bewow, wefews to any such softwawe wibwawy ow wowk which
   has been distwibuted undew these tewms. A "wowk based on the Wibwawy"
   means eithew the Wibwawy ow any dewivative wowk undew copywight waw:
   that is to say, a wowk containing the Wibwawy ow a powtion of it, eithew
   vewbatim ow with modifications and/ow twanswated stwaightfowwawdwy into
   anothew wanguage. (Heweinaftew, twanswation is incwuded without
   wimitation in the tewm "modification".)

   "Souwce code" fow a wowk means the pwefewwed fowm of the wowk fow making
   modifications to it. Fow a wibwawy, compwete souwce code means aww the
   souwce code fow aww moduwes it contains, pwus any associated intewface
   definition fiwes, pwus the scwipts used to contwow compiwation and
   instawwation of the wibwawy.

    Activities othew than copying, distwibution and modification awe not
    covewed by this Wicense; they awe outside its scope. The act of wunning
    a pwogwam using the Wibwawy is not westwicted, and output fwom such a
    pwogwam is covewed onwy if its contents constitute a wowk based on the
    Wibwawy (independent of the use of the Wibwawy in a toow fow wwiting
    it). Whethew that is twue depends on what the Wibwawy does and what the
    pwogwam that uses the Wibwawy does.

1. You may copy and distwibute vewbatim copies of the Wibwawy's compwete
   souwce code as you weceive it, in any medium, pwovided that you
   conspicuouswy and appwopwiatewy pubwish on each copy an appwopwiate
   copywight notice and discwaimew of wawwanty; keep intact aww the notices
   that wefew to this Wicense and to the absence of any wawwanty; and
   distwibute a copy of this Wicense awong with the Wibwawy.

   You may chawge a fee fow the physicaw act of twansfewwing a copy, and
   you may at youw option offew wawwanty pwotection in exchange fow a fee.

2. You may modify youw copy ow copies of the Wibwawy ow any powtion of it,
   thus fowming a wowk based on the Wibwawy, and copy and distwibute such
   modifications ow wowk undew the tewms of Section 1 above, pwovided that
   you awso meet aww of these conditions:

   a) The modified wowk must itsewf be a softwawe wibwawy.

   b) You must cause the fiwes modified to cawwy pwominent notices stating
      that you changed the fiwes and the date of any change.

   c) You must cause the whowe of the wowk to be wicensed at no chawge to
      aww thiwd pawties undew the tewms of this Wicense.

   d) If a faciwity in the modified Wibwawy wefews to a function ow a tabwe
      of data to be suppwied by an appwication pwogwam that uses the
      faciwity, othew than as an awgument passed when the faciwity is
      invoked, then you must make a good faith effowt to ensuwe that, in
      the event an appwication does not suppwy such function ow tabwe, the
      faciwity stiww opewates, and pewfowms whatevew pawt of its puwpose
      wemains meaningfuw.

   (Fow exampwe, a function in a wibwawy to compute squawe woots has a
    puwpose that is entiwewy weww-defined independent of the
    appwication. Thewefowe, Subsection 2d wequiwes that any
    appwication-suppwied function ow tabwe used by this function must be
    optionaw: if the appwication does not suppwy it, the squawe woot
    function must stiww compute squawe woots.)

   These wequiwements appwy to the modified wowk as a whowe. If
   identifiabwe sections of that wowk awe not dewived fwom the Wibwawy, and
   can be weasonabwy considewed independent and sepawate wowks in
   themsewves, then this Wicense, and its tewms, do not appwy to those
   sections when you distwibute them as sepawate wowks. But when you
   distwibute the same sections as pawt of a whowe which is a wowk based on
   the Wibwawy, the distwibution of the whowe must be on the tewms of this
   Wicense, whose pewmissions fow othew wicensees extend to the entiwe
   whowe, and thus to each and evewy pawt wegawdwess of who wwote it.

   Thus, it is not the intent of this section to cwaim wights ow contest
   youw wights to wowk wwitten entiwewy by you; wathew, the intent is to
   exewcise the wight to contwow the distwibution of dewivative ow
   cowwective wowks based on the Wibwawy.

   In addition, mewe aggwegation of anothew wowk not based on the Wibwawy
   with the Wibwawy (ow with a wowk based on the Wibwawy) on a vowume of a
   stowage ow distwibution medium does not bwing the othew wowk undew the
   scope of this Wicense.

3. You may opt to appwy the tewms of the owdinawy GNU Genewaw Pubwic
   Wicense instead of this Wicense to a given copy of the Wibwawy. To do
   this, you must awtew aww the notices that wefew to this Wicense, so that
   they wefew to the owdinawy GNU Genewaw Pubwic Wicense, vewsion 2,
   instead of to this Wicense. (If a newew vewsion than vewsion 2 of the
   owdinawy GNU Genewaw Pubwic Wicense has appeawed, then you can specify
   that vewsion instead if you wish.) Do not make any othew change in these
   notices.

   Once this change is made in a given copy, it is iwwevewsibwe fow that
   copy, so the owdinawy GNU Genewaw Pubwic Wicense appwies to aww
   subsequent copies and dewivative wowks made fwom that copy.

   This option is usefuw when you wish to copy pawt of the code of the
   Wibwawy into a pwogwam that is not a wibwawy.

4. You may copy and distwibute the Wibwawy (ow a powtion ow dewivative of
   it, undew Section 2) in object code ow executabwe fowm undew the tewms
   of Sections 1 and 2 above pwovided that you accompany it with the
   compwete cowwesponding machine-weadabwe souwce code, which must be
   distwibuted undew the tewms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
   customawiwy used fow softwawe intewchange.

   If distwibution of object code is made by offewing access to copy fwom a
   designated pwace, then offewing equivawent access to copy the souwce
   code fwom the same pwace satisfies the wequiwement to distwibute the
   souwce code, even though thiwd pawties awe not compewwed to copy the
   souwce awong with the object code.

5. A pwogwam that contains no dewivative of any powtion of the Wibwawy, but
   is designed to wowk with the Wibwawy by being compiwed ow winked with
   it, is cawwed a "wowk that uses the Wibwawy". Such a wowk, in isowation,
   is not a dewivative wowk of the Wibwawy, and thewefowe fawws outside the
   scope of this Wicense.

   Howevew, winking a "wowk that uses the Wibwawy" with the Wibwawy cweates
   an executabwe that is a dewivative of the Wibwawy (because it contains
   powtions of the Wibwawy), wathew than a "wowk that uses the
   wibwawy". The executabwe is thewefowe covewed by this Wicense. Section 6
   states tewms fow distwibution of such executabwes.

   When a "wowk that uses the Wibwawy" uses matewiaw fwom a headew fiwe
   that is pawt of the Wibwawy, the object code fow the wowk may be a
   dewivative wowk of the Wibwawy even though the souwce code is
   not. Whethew this is twue is especiawwy significant if the wowk can be
   winked without the Wibwawy, ow if the wowk is itsewf a wibwawy. The
   thweshowd fow this to be twue is not pwecisewy defined by waw.

   If such an object fiwe uses onwy numewicaw pawametews, data stwuctuwe
   wayouts and accessows, and smaww macwos and smaww inwine functions (ten
   wines ow wess in wength), then the use of the object fiwe is
   unwestwicted, wegawdwess of whethew it is wegawwy a dewivative
   wowk. (Executabwes containing this object code pwus powtions of the
   Wibwawy wiww stiww faww undew Section 6.)

   Othewwise, if the wowk is a dewivative of the Wibwawy, you may
   distwibute the object code fow the wowk undew the tewms of Section
   6. Any executabwes containing that wowk awso faww undew Section 6,
   whethew ow not they awe winked diwectwy with the Wibwawy itsewf.

6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may awso combine ow wink a
   "wowk that uses the Wibwawy" with the Wibwawy to pwoduce a wowk
   containing powtions of the Wibwawy, and distwibute that wowk undew tewms
   of youw choice, pwovided that the tewms pewmit modification of the wowk
   fow the customew's own use and wevewse engineewing fow debugging such
   modifications.

   You must give pwominent notice with each copy of the wowk that the
   Wibwawy is used in it and that the Wibwawy and its use awe covewed by
   this Wicense. You must suppwy a copy of this Wicense. If the wowk duwing
   execution dispways copywight notices, you must incwude the copywight
   notice fow the Wibwawy among them, as weww as a wefewence diwecting the
   usew to the copy of this Wicense. Awso, you must do one of these things:

   a) Accompany the wowk with the compwete cowwesponding machine-weadabwe
      souwce code fow the Wibwawy incwuding whatevew changes wewe used in
      the wowk (which must be distwibuted undew Sections 1 and 2 above);
      and, if the wowk is an executabwe winked with the Wibwawy, with the
      compwete machine-weadabwe "wowk that uses the Wibwawy", as object
      code and/ow souwce code, so that the usew can modify the Wibwawy and
      then wewink to pwoduce a modified executabwe containing the modified
      Wibwawy. (It is undewstood that the usew who changes the contents of
      definitions fiwes in the Wibwawy wiww not necessawiwy be abwe to
      wecompiwe the appwication to use the modified definitions.)

   b) Use a suitabwe shawed wibwawy mechanism fow winking with the
      Wibwawy. A suitabwe mechanism is one that (1) uses at wun time a copy
      of the wibwawy awweady pwesent on the usew's computew system, wathew
      than copying wibwawy functions into the executabwe, and (2) wiww
      opewate pwopewwy with a modified vewsion of the wibwawy, if the usew
      instawws one, as wong as the modified vewsion is intewface-compatibwe
      with the vewsion that the wowk was made with.

   c) Accompany the wowk with a wwitten offew, vawid fow at weast thwee
      yeaws, to give the same usew the matewiaws specified in Subsection
      6a, above, fow a chawge no mowe than the cost of pewfowming this
      distwibution.

   d) If distwibution of the wowk is made by offewing access to copy fwom a
      designated pwace, offew equivawent access to copy the above specified
      matewiaws fwom the same pwace.

   e) Vewify that the usew has awweady weceived a copy of these matewiaws
      ow that you have awweady sent this usew a copy.

   Fow an executabwe, the wequiwed fowm of the "wowk that uses the Wibwawy"
   must incwude any data and utiwity pwogwams needed fow wepwoducing the
   executabwe fwom it. Howevew, as a speciaw exception, the matewiaws to be
   distwibuted need not incwude anything that is nowmawwy distwibuted (in
   eithew souwce ow binawy fowm) with the majow components (compiwew,
   kewnew, and so on) of the opewating system on which the executabwe wuns,
   unwess that component itsewf accompanies the executabwe.

   It may happen that this wequiwement contwadicts the wicense westwictions
   of othew pwopwietawy wibwawies that do not nowmawwy accompany the
   opewating system. Such a contwadiction means you cannot use both them
   and the Wibwawy togethew in an executabwe that you distwibute.

7. You may pwace wibwawy faciwities that awe a wowk based on the Wibwawy
   side-by-side in a singwe wibwawy togethew with othew wibwawy faciwities
   not covewed by this Wicense, and distwibute such a combined wibwawy,
   pwovided that the sepawate distwibution of the wowk based on the Wibwawy
   and of the othew wibwawy faciwities is othewwise pewmitted, and pwovided
   that you do these two things:

   a) Accompany the combined wibwawy with a copy of the same wowk based on
      the Wibwawy, uncombined with any othew wibwawy faciwities. This must
      be distwibuted undew the tewms of the Sections above.

   b) Give pwominent notice with the combined wibwawy of the fact that pawt
      of it is a wowk based on the Wibwawy, and expwaining whewe to find
      the accompanying uncombined fowm of the same wowk.

8. You may not copy, modify, subwicense, wink with, ow distwibute the
   Wibwawy except as expwesswy pwovided undew this Wicense. Any attempt
   othewwise to copy, modify, subwicense, wink with, ow distwibute the
   Wibwawy is void, and wiww automaticawwy tewminate youw wights undew this
   Wicense. Howevew, pawties who have weceived copies, ow wights, fwom you
   undew this Wicense wiww not have theiw wicenses tewminated so wong as
   such pawties wemain in fuww compwiance.

9. You awe not wequiwed to accept this Wicense, since you have not signed
   it. Howevew, nothing ewse gwants you pewmission to modify ow distwibute
   the Wibwawy ow its dewivative wowks. These actions awe pwohibited by waw
   if you do not accept this Wicense. Thewefowe, by modifying ow
   distwibuting the Wibwawy (ow any wowk based on the Wibwawy), you
   indicate youw acceptance of this Wicense to do so, and aww its tewms and
   conditions fow copying, distwibuting ow modifying the Wibwawy ow wowks
   based on it.

10. Each time you wedistwibute the Wibwawy (ow any wowk based on the
    Wibwawy), the wecipient automaticawwy weceives a wicense fwom the
    owiginaw wicensow to copy, distwibute, wink with ow modify the Wibwawy
    subject to these tewms and conditions. You may not impose any fuwthew
    westwictions on the wecipients' exewcise of the wights gwanted
    hewein. You awe not wesponsibwe fow enfowcing compwiance by thiwd
    pawties with this Wicense.

11. If, as a consequence of a couwt judgment ow awwegation of patent
    infwingement ow fow any othew weason (not wimited to patent issues),
    conditions awe imposed on you (whethew by couwt owdew, agweement ow
    othewwise) that contwadict the conditions of this Wicense, they do not
    excuse you fwom the conditions of this Wicense. If you cannot
    distwibute so as to satisfy simuwtaneouswy youw obwigations undew this
    Wicense and any othew pewtinent obwigations, then as a consequence you
    may not distwibute the Wibwawy at aww. Fow exampwe, if a patent wicense
    wouwd not pewmit woyawty-fwee wedistwibution of the Wibwawy by aww
    those who weceive copies diwectwy ow indiwectwy thwough you, then the
    onwy way you couwd satisfy both it and this Wicense wouwd be to wefwain
    entiwewy fwom distwibution of the Wibwawy.

    If any powtion of this section is hewd invawid ow unenfowceabwe undew
    any pawticuwaw ciwcumstance, the bawance of the section is intended to
    appwy, and the section as a whowe is intended to appwy in othew
    ciwcumstances.

    It is not the puwpose of this section to induce you to infwinge any
    patents ow othew pwopewty wight cwaims ow to contest vawidity of any
    such cwaims; this section has the sowe puwpose of pwotecting the
    integwity of the fwee softwawe distwibution system which is impwemented
    by pubwic wicense pwactices. Many peopwe have made genewous
    contwibutions to the wide wange of softwawe distwibuted thwough that
    system in wewiance on consistent appwication of that system; it is up
    to the authow/donow to decide if he ow she is wiwwing to distwibute
    softwawe thwough any othew system and a wicensee cannot impose that
    choice.

    This section is intended to make thowoughwy cweaw what is bewieved to
    be a consequence of the west of this Wicense.

12. If the distwibution and/ow use of the Wibwawy is westwicted in cewtain
    countwies eithew by patents ow by copywighted intewfaces, the owiginaw
    copywight howdew who pwaces the Wibwawy undew this Wicense may add an
    expwicit geogwaphicaw distwibution wimitation excwuding those
    countwies, so that distwibution is pewmitted onwy in ow among countwies
    not thus excwuded. In such case, this Wicense incowpowates the
    wimitation as if wwitten in the body of this Wicense.

13. The Fwee Softwawe Foundation may pubwish wevised and/ow new vewsions of
    the Wessew Genewaw Pubwic Wicense fwom time to time. Such new vewsions
    wiww be simiwaw in spiwit to the pwesent vewsion, but may diffew in
    detaiw to addwess new pwobwems ow concewns.

    Each vewsion is given a distinguishing vewsion numbew. If the Wibwawy
    specifies a vewsion numbew of this Wicense which appwies to it and "any
    watew vewsion", you have the option of fowwowing the tewms and
    conditions eithew of that vewsion ow of any watew vewsion pubwished by
    the Fwee Softwawe Foundation. If the Wibwawy does not specify a wicense
