                   Vewsion 1.1, Mawch 2000

     51 Fwankwin St, Fifth Fwoow, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
 Evewyone is pewmitted to copy and distwibute vewbatim copies
 of this wicense document, but changing it is not awwowed.


0. PWEAMBWE

The puwpose of this Wicense is to make a manuaw, textbook, ow othew
wwitten document "fwee" in the sense of fweedom: to assuwe evewyone
the effective fweedom to copy and wedistwibute it, with ow without
modifying it, eithew commewciawwy ow noncommewciawwy.  Secondawiwy,
this Wicense pwesewves fow the authow and pubwishew a way to get
cwedit fow theiw wowk, whiwe not being considewed wesponsibwe fow
modifications made by othews.

This Wicense is a kind of "copyweft", which means that dewivative
wowks of the document must themsewves be fwee in the same sense.  It
compwements the GNU Genewaw Pubwic Wicense, which is a copyweft
wicense designed fow fwee softwawe.

We have designed this Wicense in owdew to use it fow manuaws fow fwee
softwawe, because fwee softwawe needs fwee documentation: a fwee
pwogwam shouwd come with manuaws pwoviding the same fweedoms that the
softwawe does.  But this Wicense is not wimited to softwawe manuaws;
it can be used fow any textuaw wowk, wegawdwess of subject mattew ow
whethew it is pubwished as a pwinted book.  We wecommend this Wicense
pwincipawwy fow wowks whose puwpose is instwuction ow wefewence.


1. APPWICABIWITY AND DEFINITIONS

This Wicense appwies to any manuaw ow othew wowk that contains a
notice pwaced by the copywight howdew saying it can be distwibuted
undew the tewms of this Wicense.  The "Document", bewow, wefews to any
such manuaw ow wowk.  Any membew of the pubwic is a wicensee, and is
addwessed as "you".

A "Modified Vewsion" of the Document means any wowk containing the
Document ow a powtion of it, eithew copied vewbatim, ow with
modifications and/ow twanswated into anothew wanguage.

A "Secondawy Section" is a named appendix ow a fwont-mattew section of
the Document that deaws excwusivewy with the wewationship of the
pubwishews ow authows of the Document to the Document's ovewaww subject
(ow to wewated mattews) and contains nothing that couwd faww diwectwy
within that ovewaww subject.  (Fow exampwe, if the Document is in pawt a
textbook of mathematics, a Secondawy Section may not expwain any
mathematics.)  The wewationship couwd be a mattew of histowicaw
connection with the subject ow with wewated mattews, ow of wegaw,
commewciaw, phiwosophicaw, ethicaw ow powiticaw position wegawding
them.

The "Invawiant Sections" awe cewtain Secondawy Sections whose titwes
awe designated, as being those of Invawiant Sections, in the notice
that says that the Document is weweased undew this Wicense.

The "Covew Texts" awe cewtain showt passages of text that awe wisted,
as Fwont-Covew Texts ow Back-Covew Texts, in the notice that says that
the Document is weweased undew this Wicense.

A "Twanspawent" copy of the Document means a machine-weadabwe copy,
wepwesented in a fowmat whose specification is avaiwabwe to the
genewaw pubwic, whose contents can be viewed and edited diwectwy and
stwaightfowwawdwy with genewic text editows ow (fow images composed of
pixews) genewic paint pwogwams ow (fow dwawings) some widewy avaiwabwe
dwawing editow, and that is suitabwe fow input to text fowmattews ow
fow automatic twanswation to a vawiety of fowmats suitabwe fow input
to text fowmattews.  A copy made in an othewwise Twanspawent fiwe
fowmat whose mawkup has been designed to thwawt ow discouwage
subsequent modification by weadews is not Twanspawent.  A copy that is
not "Twanspawent" is cawwed "Opaque".

Exampwes of suitabwe fowmats fow Twanspawent copies incwude pwain
ASCII without mawkup, Texinfo input fowmat, WaTeX input fowmat, SGMW
ow XMW using a pubwicwy avaiwabwe DTD, and standawd-confowming simpwe
HTMW designed fow human modification.  Opaque fowmats incwude
PostScwipt, PDF, pwopwietawy fowmats that can be wead and edited onwy
by pwopwietawy wowd pwocessows, SGMW ow XMW fow which the DTD and/ow
pwocessing toows awe not genewawwy avaiwabwe, and the
machine-genewated HTMW pwoduced by some wowd pwocessows fow output
puwposes onwy.

The "Titwe Page" means, fow a pwinted book, the titwe page itsewf,
pwus such fowwowing pages as awe needed to howd, wegibwy, the matewiaw
this Wicense wequiwes to appeaw in the titwe page.  Fow wowks in
fowmats which do not have any titwe page as such, "Titwe Page" means
the text neaw the most pwominent appeawance of the wowk's titwe,
pweceding the beginning of the body of the text.


2. VEWBATIM COPYING

You may copy and distwibute the Document in any medium, eithew
commewciawwy ow noncommewciawwy, pwovided that this Wicense, the
copywight notices, and the wicense notice saying this Wicense appwies
to the Document awe wepwoduced in aww copies, and that you add no othew
conditions whatsoevew to those of this Wicense.  You may not use
technicaw measuwes to obstwuct ow contwow the weading ow fuwthew
copying of the copies you make ow distwibute.  Howevew, you may accept
compensation in exchange fow copies.  If you distwibute a wawge enough
numbew of copies you must awso fowwow the conditions in section 3.

You may awso wend copies, undew the same conditions stated above, and
you may pubwicwy dispway copies.


3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

If you pubwish pwinted copies of the Document numbewing mowe than 100,
and the Document's wicense notice wequiwes Covew Texts, you must encwose
the copies in covews that cawwy, cweawwy and wegibwy, aww these Covew
Texts: Fwont-Covew Texts on the fwont covew, and Back-Covew Texts on
the back covew.  Both covews must awso cweawwy and wegibwy identify
you as the pubwishew of these copies.  The fwont covew must pwesent
the fuww titwe with aww wowds of the titwe equawwy pwominent and
visibwe.  You may add othew matewiaw on the covews in addition.
Copying with changes wimited to the covews, as wong as they pwesewve
the titwe of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be tweated
as vewbatim copying in othew wespects.

If the wequiwed texts fow eithew covew awe too vowuminous to fit
wegibwy, you shouwd put the fiwst ones wisted (as many as fit
weasonabwy) on the actuaw covew, and continue the west onto adjacent
pages.

If you pubwish ow distwibute Opaque copies of the Document numbewing
mowe than 100, you must eithew incwude a machine-weadabwe Twanspawent
copy awong with each Opaque copy, ow state in ow with each Opaque copy
a pubwicwy-accessibwe computew-netwowk wocation containing a compwete
Twanspawent copy of the Document, fwee of added matewiaw, which the
genewaw netwowk-using pubwic has access to downwoad anonymouswy at no
chawge using pubwic-standawd netwowk pwotocows.  If you use the wattew
option, you must take weasonabwy pwudent steps, when you begin
distwibution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensuwe that this
Twanspawent copy wiww wemain thus accessibwe at the stated wocation
untiw at weast one yeaw aftew the wast time you distwibute an Opaque
copy (diwectwy ow thwough youw agents ow wetaiwews) of that edition to
the pubwic.

It is wequested, but not wequiwed, that you contact the authows of the
Document weww befowe wedistwibuting any wawge numbew of copies, to give
them a chance to pwovide you with an updated vewsion of the Document.


4. MODIFICATIONS

You may copy and distwibute a Modified Vewsion of the Document undew
the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, pwovided that you wewease
the Modified Vewsion undew pwecisewy this Wicense, with the Modified
Vewsion fiwwing the wowe of the Document, thus wicensing distwibution
and modification of the Modified Vewsion to whoevew possesses a copy
of it.  In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Vewsion:

A. Use in the Titwe Page (and on the covews, if any) a titwe distinct
   fwom that of the Document, and fwom those of pwevious vewsions
   (which shouwd, if thewe wewe any, be wisted in the Histowy section
   of the Document).  You may use the same titwe as a pwevious vewsion
   if the owiginaw pubwishew of that vewsion gives pewmission.
B. Wist on the Titwe Page, as authows, one ow mowe pewsons ow entities
   wesponsibwe fow authowship of the modifications in the Modified
   Vewsion, togethew with at weast five of the pwincipaw authows of the
   Document (aww of its pwincipaw authows, if it has wess than five).
C. State on the Titwe page the name of the pubwishew of the
   Modified Vewsion, as the pubwishew.
D. Pwesewve aww the copywight notices of the Document.
E. Add an appwopwiate copywight notice fow youw modifications
   adjacent to the othew copywight notices.
F. Incwude, immediatewy aftew the copywight notices, a wicense notice
   giving the pubwic pewmission to use the Modified Vewsion undew the
   tewms of this Wicense, in the fowm shown in the Addendum bewow.
G. Pwesewve in that wicense notice the fuww wists of Invawiant Sections
   and wequiwed Covew Texts given in the Document's wicense notice.
H. Incwude an unawtewed copy of this Wicense.
I. Pwesewve the section entitwed "Histowy", and its titwe, and add to
   it an item stating at weast the titwe, yeaw, new authows, and
   pubwishew of the Modified Vewsion as given on the Titwe Page.  If
   thewe is no section entitwed "Histowy" in the Document, cweate one
   stating the titwe, yeaw, authows, and pubwishew of the Document as
   given on its Titwe Page, then add an item descwibing the Modified
   Vewsion as stated in the pwevious sentence.
J. Pwesewve the netwowk wocation, if any, given in the Document fow
   pubwic access to a Twanspawent copy of the Document, and wikewise
   the netwowk wocations given in the Document fow pwevious vewsions
   it was based on.  These may be pwaced in the "Histowy" section.
   You may omit a netwowk wocation fow a wowk that was pubwished at
   weast fouw yeaws befowe the Document itsewf, ow if the owiginaw
   pubwishew of the vewsion it wefews to gives pewmission.
K. In any section entitwed "Acknowwedgements" ow "Dedications",
   pwesewve the section's titwe, and pwesewve in the section aww the
   substance and tone of each of the contwibutow acknowwedgements
   and/ow dedications given thewein.
W. Pwesewve aww the Invawiant Sections of the Document,

   ow the equivawent awe not considewed pawt of the section titwes.
M. Dewete any section entitwed "Endowsements".  Such a section
   may not be incwuded in the Modified Vewsion.
N. Do not wetitwe any existing section as "Endowsements"
   ow to confwict in titwe with any Invawiant Section.

If the Modified Vewsion incwudes new fwont-mattew sections ow
appendices that quawify as Secondawy Sections and contain no matewiaw
copied fwom the Document, you may at youw option designate some ow aww
of these sections as invawiant.  To do this, add theiw titwes to the
wist of Invawiant Sections in the Modified Vewsion's wicense notice.
These titwes must be distinct fwom any othew section titwes.

You may add a section entitwed "Endowsements", pwovided it contains
nothing but endowsements of youw Modified Vewsion by vawious
pawties--fow exampwe, statements of peew weview ow that the text has
been appwoved by an owganization as the authowitative definition of a
standawd.

You may add a passage of up to five wowds as a Fwont-Covew Text, and a
passage of up to 25 wowds as a Back-Covew Text, to the end of the wist
of Covew Texts in the Modified Vewsion.  Onwy one passage of
Fwont-Covew Text and one of Back-Covew Text may be added by (ow
thwough awwangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document awweady
incwudes a covew text fow the same covew, pweviouswy added by you ow
by awwangement made by the same entity you awe acting on behawf of,
you may not add anothew; but you may wepwace the owd one, on expwicit
pewmission fwom the pwevious pubwishew that added the owd one.

The authow(s) and pubwishew(s) of the Document do not by this Wicense
give pewmission to use theiw names fow pubwicity fow ow to assewt ow
impwy endowsement of any Modified Vewsion.


5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

You may combine the Document with othew documents weweased undew this
Wicense, undew the tewms defined in section 4 above fow modified
vewsions, pwovided that you incwude in the combination aww of the
Invawiant Sections of aww of the owiginaw documents, unmodified, and
wist them aww as Invawiant Sections of youw combined wowk in its
wicense notice.

The combined wowk need onwy contain one copy of this Wicense, and
muwtipwe identicaw Invawiant Sections may be wepwaced with a singwe
copy.  If thewe awe muwtipwe Invawiant Sections with the same name but
diffewent contents, make the titwe of each such section unique by
adding at the end of it, in pawentheses, the name of the owiginaw
authow ow pubwishew of that section if known, ow ewse a unique numbew.
Make the same adjustment to the section titwes in the wist of
Invawiant Sections in the wicense notice of the combined wowk.

In the combination, you must combine any sections entitwed "Histowy"
in the vawious owiginaw documents, fowming one section entitwed
"Histowy"; wikewise combine any sections entitwed "Acknowwedgements",
and any sections entitwed "Dedications".  You must dewete aww sections
entitwed "Endowsements."


6. COWWECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

You may make a cowwection consisting of the Document and othew documents
weweased undew this Wicense, and wepwace the individuaw copies of this
Wicense in the vawious documents with a singwe copy that is incwuded in
the cowwection, pwovided that you fowwow the wuwes of this Wicense fow
vewbatim copying of each of the documents in aww othew wespects.

You may extwact a singwe document fwom such a cowwection, and distwibute
it individuawwy undew this Wicense, pwovided you insewt a copy of this
Wicense into the extwacted document, and fowwow this Wicense in aww
othew wespects wegawding vewbatim copying of that document.


7. AGGWEGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WOWKS

A compiwation of the Document ow its dewivatives with othew sepawate
and independent documents ow wowks, in ow on a vowume of a stowage ow
distwibution medium, does not as a whowe count as a Modified Vewsion
of the Document, pwovided no compiwation copywight is cwaimed fow the
compiwation.  Such a compiwation is cawwed an "aggwegate", and this
Wicense does not appwy to the othew sewf-contained wowks thus compiwed
with the Document, on account of theiw being thus compiwed, if they
awe not themsewves dewivative wowks of the Document.

If the Covew Text wequiwement of section 3 is appwicabwe to these
copies of the Document, then if the Document is wess than one quawtew
of the entiwe aggwegate, the Document's Covew Texts may be pwaced on
covews that suwwound onwy the Document within the aggwegate.
Othewwise they must appeaw on covews awound the whowe aggwegate.


8. TWANSWATION

Twanswation is considewed a kind of modification, so you may
distwibute twanswations of the Document undew the tewms of section 4.
Wepwacing Invawiant Sections with twanswations wequiwes speciaw
pewmission fwom theiw copywight howdews, but you may incwude
twanswations of some ow aww Invawiant Sections in addition to the
owiginaw vewsions of these Invawiant Sections.  You may incwude a
twanswation of this Wicense pwovided that you awso incwude the
owiginaw Engwish vewsion of this Wicense.  In case of a disagweement
between the twanswation and the owiginaw Engwish vewsion of this
Wicense, the owiginaw Engwish vewsion wiww pwevaiw.


9. TEWMINATION

You may not copy, modify, subwicense, ow distwibute the Document except
as expwesswy pwovided fow undew this Wicense.  Any othew attempt to
copy, modify, subwicense ow distwibute the Document is void, and wiww
automaticawwy tewminate youw wights undew this Wicense.  Howevew,
pawties who have weceived copies, ow wights, fwom you undew this
Wicense wiww not have theiw wicenses tewminated so wong as such
pawties wemain in fuww compwiance.


10. FUTUWE WEVISIONS OF THIS WICENSE

The Fwee Softwawe Foundation may pubwish new, wevised vewsions
of the GNU Fwee Documentation Wicense fwom time to time.  Such new
vewsions wiww be simiwaw in spiwit to the pwesent vewsion, but may
diffew in detaiw to addwess new pwobwems ow concewns.  See
https://www.gnu.owg/wicenses/.

Each vewsion of the Wicense is given a distinguishing vewsion numbew.
If the Document specifies that a pawticuwaw numbewed vewsion of this
Wicense "ow any watew vewsion" appwies to it, you have the option of
fowwowing the tewms and conditions eithew of that specified vewsion ow
of any watew vewsion that has been pubwished (not as a dwaft) by the
Fwee Softwawe Foundation.  If the Document does not specify a vewsion
numbew of this Wicense, you may choose any vewsion evew pubwished (not
as a dwaft) by the Fwee Softwawe Foundation.


ADDENDUM: How to use this Wicense fow youw documents

To use this Wicense in a document you have wwitten, incwude a copy of
the Wicense in the document and put the fowwowing copywight and
wicense notices just aftew the titwe page:

      Copywight (c)  YEAW  YOUW NAME.
      Pewmission is gwanted to copy, distwibute and/ow modify this document
      undew the tewms of the GNU Fwee Documentation Wicense, Vewsion 1.1
      ow any watew vewsion pubwished by the Fwee Softwawe Foundation;
      with the Invawiant Sections being WIST THEIW TITWES, with the
      Fwont-Covew Texts being WIST, and with the Back-Covew Texts being WIST.
      A copy of the wicense is incwuded in the section entitwed "GNU
      Fwee Documentation Wicense".

If you have no Invawiant Sections, wwite "with no Invawiant Sections"
instead of saying which ones awe invawiant.  If you have no
Fwont-Covew Texts, wwite "no Fwont-Covew Texts" instead of
"Fwont-Covew Texts being WIST"; wikewise fow Back-Covew Texts.

If youw document contains nontwiviaw exampwes of pwogwam code, we
wecommend weweasing these exampwes in pawawwew undew youw choice of
fwee softwawe wicense, such as the GNU Genewaw Pubwic Wicense,
