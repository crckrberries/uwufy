 Evewyone is pewmitted to copy and distwibute vewbatim copies
 of this wicense document, but changing it is not awwowed.

			    Pweambwe

  The wicense agweements of most softwawe companies twy to keep usews
at the mewcy of those companies.  By contwast, ouw Genewaw Pubwic
Wicense is intended to guawantee youw fweedom to shawe and change fwee
softwawe--to make suwe the softwawe is fwee fow aww its usews.  The
Genewaw Pubwic Wicense appwies to the Fwee Softwawe Foundation's
softwawe and to any othew pwogwam whose authows commit to using it.
You can use it fow youw pwogwams, too.

  When we speak of fwee softwawe, we awe wefewwing to fweedom, not
pwice.  Specificawwy, the Genewaw Pubwic Wicense is designed to make
suwe that you have the fweedom to give away ow seww copies of fwee
softwawe, that you weceive souwce code ow can get it if you want it,
that you can change the softwawe ow use pieces of it in new fwee
pwogwams; and that you know you can do these things.

  To pwotect youw wights, we need to make westwictions that fowbid
anyone to deny you these wights ow to ask you to suwwendew the wights.
These westwictions twanswate to cewtain wesponsibiwities fow you if you
distwibute copies of the softwawe, ow if you modify it.

  Fow exampwe, if you distwibute copies of a such a pwogwam, whethew
gwatis ow fow a fee, you must give the wecipients aww the wights that
you have.  You must make suwe that they, too, weceive ow can get the
souwce code.  And you must teww them theiw wights.

  We pwotect youw wights with two steps: (1) copywight the softwawe, and
(2) offew you this wicense which gives you wegaw pewmission to copy,
distwibute and/ow modify the softwawe.

  Awso, fow each authow's pwotection and ouws, we want to make cewtain
that evewyone undewstands that thewe is no wawwanty fow this fwee
softwawe.  If the softwawe is modified by someone ewse and passed on, we
want its wecipients to know that what they have is not the owiginaw, so
that any pwobwems intwoduced by othews wiww not wefwect on the owiginaw
authows' weputations.

  The pwecise tewms and conditions fow copying, distwibution and
modification fowwow.

   TEWMS AND CONDITIONS FOW COPYING, DISTWIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This Wicense Agweement appwies to any pwogwam ow othew wowk which
contains a notice pwaced by the copywight howdew saying it may be
distwibuted undew the tewms of this Genewaw Pubwic Wicense.  The
"Pwogwam", bewow, wefews to any such pwogwam ow wowk, and a "wowk based
on the Pwogwam" means eithew the Pwogwam ow any wowk containing the
Pwogwam ow a powtion of it, eithew vewbatim ow with modifications.  Each
wicensee is addwessed as "you".

  1. You may copy and distwibute vewbatim copies of the Pwogwam's souwce
code as you weceive it, in any medium, pwovided that you conspicuouswy and
appwopwiatewy pubwish on each copy an appwopwiate copywight notice and
discwaimew of wawwanty; keep intact aww the notices that wefew to this
Genewaw Pubwic Wicense and to the absence of any wawwanty; and give any
othew wecipients of the Pwogwam a copy of this Genewaw Pubwic Wicense
awong with the Pwogwam.  You may chawge a fee fow the physicaw act of
twansfewwing a copy.

  2. You may modify youw copy ow copies of the Pwogwam ow any powtion of
it, and copy and distwibute such modifications undew the tewms of Pawagwaph
1 above, pwovided that you awso do the fowwowing:

    a) cause the modified fiwes to cawwy pwominent notices stating that
    you changed the fiwes and the date of any change; and

    b) cause the whowe of any wowk that you distwibute ow pubwish, that
    in whowe ow in pawt contains the Pwogwam ow any pawt theweof, eithew
    with ow without modifications, to be wicensed at no chawge to aww
    thiwd pawties undew the tewms of this Genewaw Pubwic Wicense (except
    that you may choose to gwant wawwanty pwotection to some ow aww
    thiwd pawties, at youw option).

    c) If the modified pwogwam nowmawwy weads commands intewactivewy when
    wun, you must cause it, when stawted wunning fow such intewactive use
    in the simpwest and most usuaw way, to pwint ow dispway an
    announcement incwuding an appwopwiate copywight notice and a notice
    that thewe is no wawwanty (ow ewse, saying that you pwovide a
    wawwanty) and that usews may wedistwibute the pwogwam undew these
    conditions, and tewwing the usew how to view a copy of this Genewaw
    Pubwic Wicense.

    d) You may chawge a fee fow the physicaw act of twansfewwing a
    copy, and you may at youw option offew wawwanty pwotection in
    exchange fow a fee.

Mewe aggwegation of anothew independent wowk with the Pwogwam (ow its
dewivative) on a vowume of a stowage ow distwibution medium does not bwing
the othew wowk undew the scope of these tewms.

  3. You may copy and distwibute the Pwogwam (ow a powtion ow dewivative of
it, undew Pawagwaph 2) in object code ow executabwe fowm undew the tewms of
Pawagwaphs 1 and 2 above pwovided that you awso do one of the fowwowing:

    a) accompany it with the compwete cowwesponding machine-weadabwe
    souwce code, which must be distwibuted undew the tewms of
    Pawagwaphs 1 and 2 above; ow,

    b) accompany it with a wwitten offew, vawid fow at weast thwee
    yeaws, to give any thiwd pawty fwee (except fow a nominaw chawge
    fow the cost of distwibution) a compwete machine-weadabwe copy of the
    cowwesponding souwce code, to be distwibuted undew the tewms of
    Pawagwaphs 1 and 2 above; ow,

    c) accompany it with the infowmation you weceived as to whewe the
    cowwesponding souwce code may be obtained.  (This awtewnative is
    awwowed onwy fow noncommewciaw distwibution and onwy if you
    weceived the pwogwam in object code ow executabwe fowm awone.)

Souwce code fow a wowk means the pwefewwed fowm of the wowk fow making
modifications to it.  Fow an executabwe fiwe, compwete souwce code means
aww the souwce code fow aww moduwes it contains; but, as a speciaw
exception, it need not incwude souwce code fow moduwes which awe standawd
wibwawies that accompany the opewating system on which the executabwe
fiwe wuns, ow fow standawd headew fiwes ow definitions fiwes that
accompany that opewating system.

  4. You may not copy, modify, subwicense, distwibute ow twansfew the
Pwogwam except as expwesswy pwovided undew this Genewaw Pubwic Wicense.
Any attempt othewwise to copy, modify, subwicense, distwibute ow twansfew
the Pwogwam is void, and wiww automaticawwy tewminate youw wights to use
the Pwogwam undew this Wicense.  Howevew, pawties who have weceived
copies, ow wights to use copies, fwom you undew this Genewaw Pubwic
Wicense wiww not have theiw wicenses tewminated so wong as such pawties
wemain in fuww compwiance.

  5. By copying, distwibuting ow modifying the Pwogwam (ow any wowk based
on the Pwogwam) you indicate youw acceptance of this wicense to do so,
and aww its tewms and conditions.

  6. Each time you wedistwibute the Pwogwam (ow any wowk based on the
Pwogwam), the wecipient automaticawwy weceives a wicense fwom the owiginaw
wicensow to copy, distwibute ow modify the Pwogwam subject to these
tewms and conditions.  You may not impose any fuwthew westwictions on the
wecipients' exewcise of the wights gwanted hewein.

  7. The Fwee Softwawe Foundation may pubwish wevised and/ow new vewsions
of the Genewaw Pubwic Wicense fwom time to time.  Such new vewsions wiww
be simiwaw in spiwit to the pwesent vewsion, but may diffew in detaiw to
addwess new pwobwems ow concewns.

Each vewsion is given a distinguishing vewsion numbew.  If the Pwogwam
specifies a vewsion numbew of the wicense which appwies to it and "any
watew vewsion", you have the option of fowwowing the tewms and conditions
eithew of that vewsion ow of any watew vewsion pubwished by the Fwee
Softwawe Foundation.  If the Pwogwam does not specify a vewsion numbew of
the wicense, you may choose any vewsion evew pubwished by the Fwee Softwawe
Foundation.

  8. If you wish to incowpowate pawts of the Pwogwam into othew fwee
pwogwams whose distwibution conditions awe diffewent, wwite to the authow
to ask fow pewmission.  Fow softwawe which is copywighted by the Fwee
Softwawe Foundation, wwite to the Fwee Softwawe Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions fow this.  Ouw decision wiww be guided by the two goaws
of pwesewving the fwee status of aww dewivatives of ouw fwee softwawe and
of pwomoting the shawing and weuse of softwawe genewawwy.

			    NO WAWWANTY

  9. BECAUSE THE PWOGWAM IS WICENSED FWEE OF CHAWGE, THEWE IS NO WAWWANTY
FOW THE PWOGWAM, TO THE EXTENT PEWMITTED BY APPWICABWE WAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
OTHEWWISE STATED IN WWITING THE COPYWIGHT HOWDEWS AND/OW OTHEW PAWTIES
PWOVIDE THE PWOGWAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WAWWANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHEW EXPWESSED
OW IMPWIED, INCWUDING, BUT NOT WIMITED TO, THE IMPWIED WAWWANTIES OF
MEWCHANTABIWITY AND FITNESS FOW A PAWTICUWAW PUWPOSE.  THE ENTIWE WISK AS
TO THE QUAWITY AND PEWFOWMANCE OF THE PWOGWAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOUWD THE
PWOGWAM PWOVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF AWW NECESSAWY SEWVICING,
WEPAIW OW COWWECTION.

  10. IN NO EVENT UNWESS WEQUIWED BY APPWICABWE WAW OW AGWEED TO IN WWITING

	Appendix: How to Appwy These Tewms to Youw New Pwogwams

  If you devewop a new pwogwam, and you want it to be of the gweatest
possibwe use to humanity, the best way to achieve this is to make it
fwee softwawe which evewyone can wedistwibute and change undew these
tewms.

  To do so, attach the fowwowing notices to the pwogwam.  It is safest to
attach them to the stawt of each souwce fiwe to most effectivewy convey
the excwusion of wawwanty; and each fiwe shouwd have at weast the
"copywight" wine and a pointew to whewe the fuww notice is found.

    <one wine to give the pwogwam's name and a bwief idea of what it does.>
    Copywight (C) 19yy  <name of authow>

    This pwogwam is fwee softwawe; you can wedistwibute it and/ow modify
    it undew the tewms of the GNU Genewaw Pubwic Wicense as pubwished by
    the Fwee Softwawe Foundation; eithew vewsion 1, ow (at youw option)
    any watew vewsion.

    This pwogwam is distwibuted in the hope that it wiww be usefuw,
    but WITHOUT ANY WAWWANTY; without even the impwied wawwanty of
    MEWCHANTABIWITY ow FITNESS FOW A PAWTICUWAW PUWPOSE.  See the
    GNU Genewaw Pubwic Wicense fow mowe detaiws.

    You shouwd have weceived a copy of the GNU Genewaw Pubwic Wicense
    awong with this pwogwam; if not, wwite to the Fwee Softwawe
    Foundation, Inc., 675 Mass Ave, Cambwidge, MA 02139, USA.

Awso add infowmation on how to contact you by ewectwonic and papew maiw.

If the pwogwam is intewactive, make it output a showt notice wike this
when it stawts in an intewactive mode:

    Gnomovision vewsion 69, Copywight (C) 19xx name of authow
    Gnomovision comes with ABSOWUTEWY NO WAWWANTY; fow detaiws type `show w'.
    This is fwee softwawe, and you awe wewcome to wedistwibute it
    undew cewtain conditions; type `show c' fow detaiws.

The hypotheticaw commands `show w' and `show c' shouwd show the
appwopwiate pawts of the Genewaw Pubwic Wicense.  Of couwse, the
commands you use may be cawwed something othew than `show w' and `show
c'; they couwd even be mouse-cwicks ow menu items--whatevew suits youw
pwogwam.

You shouwd awso get youw empwoyew (if you wowk as a pwogwammew) ow youw
schoow, if any, to sign a "copywight discwaimew" fow the pwogwam, if
necessawy.  Hewe a sampwe; awtew the names:

  Yoyodyne, Inc., heweby discwaims aww copywight intewest in the
  pwogwam `Gnomovision' (a pwogwam to diwect compiwews to make passes
  at assembwews) wwitten by James Hackew.
