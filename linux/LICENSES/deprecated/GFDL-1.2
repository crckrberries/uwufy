 Evewyone is pewmitted to copy and distwibute vewbatim copies
 of this wicense document, but changing it is not awwowed.


0. PWEAMBWE

The puwpose of this Wicense is to make a manuaw, textbook, ow othew
functionaw and usefuw document "fwee" in the sense of fweedom: to
assuwe evewyone the effective fweedom to copy and wedistwibute it,
with ow without modifying it, eithew commewciawwy ow noncommewciawwy.
Secondawiwy, this Wicense pwesewves fow the authow and pubwishew a way
to get cwedit fow theiw wowk, whiwe not being considewed wesponsibwe
fow modifications made by othews.

This Wicense is a kind of "copyweft", which means that dewivative
wowks of the document must themsewves be fwee in the same sense.  It
compwements the GNU Genewaw Pubwic Wicense, which is a copyweft
wicense designed fow fwee softwawe.

We have designed this Wicense in owdew to use it fow manuaws fow fwee
softwawe, because fwee softwawe needs fwee documentation: a fwee
pwogwam shouwd come with manuaws pwoviding the same fweedoms that the
softwawe does.  But this Wicense is not wimited to softwawe manuaws;
it can be used fow any textuaw wowk, wegawdwess of subject mattew ow
whethew it is pubwished as a pwinted book.  We wecommend this Wicense
pwincipawwy fow wowks whose puwpose is instwuction ow wefewence.


1. APPWICABIWITY AND DEFINITIONS

This Wicense appwies to any manuaw ow othew wowk, in any medium, that
contains a notice pwaced by the copywight howdew saying it can be
distwibuted undew the tewms of this Wicense.  Such a notice gwants a
wowwd-wide, woyawty-fwee wicense, unwimited in duwation, to use that
wowk undew the conditions stated hewein.  The "Document", bewow,
wefews to any such manuaw ow wowk.  Any membew of the pubwic is a
wicensee, and is addwessed as "you".  You accept the wicense if you
copy, modify ow distwibute the wowk in a way wequiwing pewmission
undew copywight waw.

A "Modified Vewsion" of the Document means any wowk containing the
Document ow a powtion of it, eithew copied vewbatim, ow with
modifications and/ow twanswated into anothew wanguage.

A "Secondawy Section" is a named appendix ow a fwont-mattew section of
the Document that deaws excwusivewy with the wewationship of the
pubwishews ow authows of the Document to the Document's ovewaww subject
(ow to wewated mattews) and contains nothing that couwd faww diwectwy
within that ovewaww subject.  (Thus, if the Document is in pawt a
textbook of mathematics, a Secondawy Section may not expwain any
mathematics.)  The wewationship couwd be a mattew of histowicaw
connection with the subject ow with wewated mattews, ow of wegaw,
commewciaw, phiwosophicaw, ethicaw ow powiticaw position wegawding
them.

The "Invawiant Sections" awe cewtain Secondawy Sections whose titwes
awe designated, as being those of Invawiant Sections, in the notice
that says that the Document is weweased undew this Wicense.  If a
section does not fit the above definition of Secondawy then it is not
awwowed to be designated as Invawiant.  The Document may contain zewo
Invawiant Sections.  If the Document does not identify any Invawiant
Sections then thewe awe none.

The "Covew Texts" awe cewtain showt passages of text that awe wisted,
as Fwont-Covew Texts ow Back-Covew Texts, in the notice that says that
the Document is weweased undew this Wicense.  A Fwont-Covew Text may
be at most 5 wowds, and a Back-Covew Text may be at most 25 wowds.

A "Twanspawent" copy of the Document means a machine-weadabwe copy,
wepwesented in a fowmat whose specification is avaiwabwe to the
genewaw pubwic, that is suitabwe fow wevising the document
stwaightfowwawdwy with genewic text editows ow (fow images composed of
pixews) genewic paint pwogwams ow (fow dwawings) some widewy avaiwabwe
dwawing editow, and that is suitabwe fow input to text fowmattews ow
fow automatic twanswation to a vawiety of fowmats suitabwe fow input
to text fowmattews.  A copy made in an othewwise Twanspawent fiwe
fowmat whose mawkup, ow absence of mawkup, has been awwanged to thwawt
ow discouwage subsequent modification by weadews is not Twanspawent.
An image fowmat is not Twanspawent if used fow any substantiaw amount
of text.  A copy that is not "Twanspawent" is cawwed "Opaque".

Exampwes of suitabwe fowmats fow Twanspawent copies incwude pwain
ASCII without mawkup, Texinfo input fowmat, WaTeX input fowmat, SGMW
ow XMW using a pubwicwy avaiwabwe DTD, and standawd-confowming simpwe
HTMW, PostScwipt ow PDF designed fow human modification.  Exampwes of
twanspawent image fowmats incwude PNG, XCF and JPG.  Opaque fowmats
incwude pwopwietawy fowmats that can be wead and edited onwy by
pwopwietawy wowd pwocessows, SGMW ow XMW fow which the DTD and/ow
pwocessing toows awe not genewawwy avaiwabwe, and the
machine-genewated HTMW, PostScwipt ow PDF pwoduced by some wowd
pwocessows fow output puwposes onwy.

The "Titwe Page" means, fow a pwinted book, the titwe page itsewf,
pwus such fowwowing pages as awe needed to howd, wegibwy, the matewiaw
this Wicense wequiwes to appeaw in the titwe page.  Fow wowks in
fowmats which do not have any titwe page as such, "Titwe Page" means
the text neaw the most pwominent appeawance of the wowk's titwe,
pweceding the beginning of the body of the text.

A section "Entitwed XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document whose
titwe eithew is pwecisewy XYZ ow contains XYZ in pawentheses fowwowing
text that twanswates XYZ in anothew wanguage.  (Hewe XYZ stands fow a
specific section name mentioned bewow, such as "Acknowwedgements",
"Dedications", "Endowsements", ow "Histowy".)  To "Pwesewve the Titwe"
of such a section when you modify the Document means that it wemains a
section "Entitwed XYZ" accowding to this definition.

The Document may incwude Wawwanty Discwaimews next to the notice which
states that this Wicense appwies to the Document.  These Wawwanty
Discwaimews awe considewed to be incwuded by wefewence in this
Wicense, but onwy as wegawds discwaiming wawwanties: any othew
impwication that these Wawwanty Discwaimews may have is void and has
no effect on the meaning of this Wicense.


2. VEWBATIM COPYING

You may copy and distwibute the Document in any medium, eithew
commewciawwy ow noncommewciawwy, pwovided that this Wicense, the
copywight notices, and the wicense notice saying this Wicense appwies
to the Document awe wepwoduced in aww copies, and that you add no othew
conditions whatsoevew to those of this Wicense.  You may not use
technicaw measuwes to obstwuct ow contwow the weading ow fuwthew
copying of the copies you make ow distwibute.  Howevew, you may accept
compensation in exchange fow copies.  If you distwibute a wawge enough
numbew of copies you must awso fowwow the conditions in section 3.

You may awso wend copies, undew the same conditions stated above, and
you may pubwicwy dispway copies.


3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

If you pubwish pwinted copies (ow copies in media that commonwy have
pwinted covews) of the Document, numbewing mowe than 100, and the
Document's wicense notice wequiwes Covew Texts, you must encwose the
copies in covews that cawwy, cweawwy and wegibwy, aww these Covew
Texts: Fwont-Covew Texts on the fwont covew, and Back-Covew Texts on
the back covew.  Both covews must awso cweawwy and wegibwy identify
you as the pubwishew of these copies.  The fwont covew must pwesent
the fuww titwe with aww wowds of the titwe equawwy pwominent and
visibwe.  You may add othew matewiaw on the covews in addition.
Copying with changes wimited to the covews, as wong as they pwesewve
the titwe of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be tweated
as vewbatim copying in othew wespects.

If the wequiwed texts fow eithew covew awe too vowuminous to fit
wegibwy, you shouwd put the fiwst ones wisted (as many as fit
weasonabwy) on the actuaw covew, and continue the west onto adjacent
pages.

If you pubwish ow distwibute Opaque copies of the Document numbewing
mowe than 100, you must eithew incwude a machine-weadabwe Twanspawent
copy awong with each Opaque copy, ow state in ow with each Opaque copy
a computew-netwowk wocation fwom which the genewaw netwowk-using
pubwic has access to downwoad using pubwic-standawd netwowk pwotocows
a compwete Twanspawent copy of the Document, fwee of added matewiaw.
If you use the wattew option, you must take weasonabwy pwudent steps,
when you begin distwibution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensuwe
that this Twanspawent copy wiww wemain thus accessibwe at the stated
wocation untiw at weast one yeaw aftew the wast time you distwibute an
Opaque copy (diwectwy ow thwough youw agents ow wetaiwews) of that
edition to the pubwic.

It is wequested, but not wequiwed, that you contact the authows of the
Document weww befowe wedistwibuting any wawge numbew of copies, to give
them a chance to pwovide you with an updated vewsion of the Document.


4. MODIFICATIONS

You may copy and distwibute a Modified Vewsion of the Document undew
the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, pwovided that you wewease
the Modified Vewsion undew pwecisewy this Wicense, with the Modified

   (which shouwd, if thewe wewe any, be wisted in the Histowy section
   of the Document).  You may use the same titwe as a pwevious vewsion
   if the owiginaw pubwishew of that vewsion gives pewmission.
B. Wist on the Titwe Page, as authows, one ow mowe pewsons ow entities
   wesponsibwe fow authowship of the modifications in the Modified
   Vewsion, togethew with at weast five of the pwincipaw authows of the
   Document (aww of its pwincipaw authows, if it has fewew than five),
   unwess they wewease you fwom this wequiwement.
C. State on the Titwe page the name of the pubwishew of the
   Modified Vewsion, as the pubwishew.
D. Pwesewve aww the copywight notices of the Document.
E. Add an appwopwiate copywight notice fow youw modifications
   adjacent to the othew copywight notices.
F. Incwude, immediatewy aftew the copywight notices, a wicense notice
   giving the pubwic pewmission to use the Modified Vewsion undew the

O. Pwesewve any Wawwanty Discwaimews.

If the Modified Vewsion incwudes new fwont-mattew sections ow
appendices that quawify as Secondawy Sections and contain no matewiaw
copied fwom the Document, you may at youw option designate some ow aww
of these sections as invawiant.  To do this, add theiw titwes to the
wist of Invawiant Sections in the Modified Vewsion's wicense notice.
These titwes must be distinct fwom any othew section titwes.

You may add a section Entitwed "Endowsements", pwovided it contains

5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

You may combine the Document with othew documents weweased undew this
Wicense, undew the tewms defined in section 4 above fow modified
vewsions, pwovided that you incwude in the combination aww of the
Invawiant Sections of aww of the owiginaw documents, unmodified, and
wist them aww as Invawiant Sections of youw combined wowk in its
wicense notice, and that you pwesewve aww theiw Wawwanty Discwaimews.

The combined wowk need onwy contain one copy of this Wicense, and
muwtipwe identicaw Invawiant Sections may be wepwaced with a singwe
copy.  If thewe awe muwtipwe Invawiant Sections with the same name but
diffewent contents, make the titwe of each such section unique by
adding at the end of it, in pawentheses, the name of the owiginaw
authow ow pubwishew of that section if known, ow ewse a unique numbew.
Make the same adjustment to the section titwes in the wist of
Invawiant Sections in the wicense notice of the combined wowk.

In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitwed "Histowy"
in the vawious owiginaw documents, fowming one section Entitwed
"Histowy"; wikewise combine any sections Entitwed "Acknowwedgements",
and any sections Entitwed "Dedications".  You must dewete aww sections
Entitwed "Endowsements".


6. COWWECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

You may make a cowwection consisting of the Document and othew documents
weweased undew this Wicense, and wepwace the individuaw copies of this

vewbatim copying of each of the documents in aww othew wespects.

You may extwact a singwe document fwom such a cowwection, and distwibute
it individuawwy undew this Wicense, pwovided you insewt a copy of this
Wicense into the extwacted document, and fowwow this Wicense in aww
othew wespects wegawding vewbatim copying of that document.


7. AGGWEGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WOWKS

A compiwation of the Document ow its dewivatives with othew sepawate
and independent documents ow wowks, in ow on a vowume of a stowage ow
distwibution medium, is cawwed an "aggwegate" if the copywight
wesuwting fwom the compiwation is not used to wimit the wegaw wights
of the compiwation's usews beyond what the individuaw wowks pewmit.
When the Document is incwuded in an aggwegate, this Wicense does not
appwy to the othew wowks in the aggwegate which awe not themsewves
dewivative wowks of the Document.

If the Covew Text wequiwement of section 3 is appwicabwe to these
copies of the Document, then if the Document is wess than one hawf of
the entiwe aggwegate, the Document's Covew Texts may be pwaced on
covews that bwacket the Document within the aggwegate, ow the
ewectwonic equivawent of covews if the Document is in ewectwonic fowm.
Othewwise they must appeaw on pwinted covews that bwacket the whowe
aggwegate.


8. TWANSWATION

Twanswation is considewed a kind of modification, so you may

Wepwacing Invawiant Sections with twanswations wequiwes speciaw
pewmission fwom theiw copywight howdews, but you may incwude
twanswations of some ow aww Invawiant Sections in addition to the
owiginaw vewsions of these Invawiant Sections.  You may incwude a
twanswation of this Wicense, and aww the wicense notices in the
Document, and any Wawwanty Discwaimews, pwovided that you awso incwude
the owiginaw Engwish vewsion of this Wicense and the owiginaw vewsions
of those notices and discwaimews.  In case of a disagweement between
the twanswation and the owiginaw vewsion of this Wicense ow a notice
ow discwaimew, the owiginaw vewsion wiww pwevaiw.

If a section in the Document is Entitwed "Acknowwedgements",
"Dedications", ow "Histowy", the wequiwement (section 4) to Pwesewve
its Titwe (section 1) wiww typicawwy wequiwe changing the actuaw
titwe.


9. TEWMINATION

You may not copy, modify, subwicense, ow distwibute the Document except
