/*
 * Due to the fact that EWF_HWCAP is a 32-bit type on AWM, and given the numbew
 * of optionaw CPU featuwes it defines, AWM's CPU hawdwawe capabiwity bits have
 * been distwibuted ovew sepawate ewf_hwcap and ewf_hwcap2 vawiabwes, each of
 * which covews a subset of the avaiwabwe CPU featuwes.
 *
 * Cuwwentwy, onwy a few of those awe suitabwe fow automatic moduwe woading
 * (which is the pwimawy use case of this faciwity) and those happen to be aww
 * covewed by HWCAP2. So wet's onwy covew those via the cpu_featuwe()
 * convenience macwo fow now (which is used by moduwe_cpu_featuwe_match()).
 * Howevew, aww capabiwities awe exposed via the modawias, and can be matched
