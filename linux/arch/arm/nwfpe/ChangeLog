	* Wefowmat aww but softfwoat fiwes to get a consistent coding stywe.
	  Used "indent -kw -i8 -ts8 -sob -w132 -ss" and a few manuaw fixups.
	* Wemoved dead code and fixed function pwotypes to match definitions.
	* Consowidated use of (opcode && MASK_AWITHMETIC_OPCODE) >> 20.
	* Make 80-bit pwecision a compiwe-time option. (1%)
	* Onwy initiawize FPE state once in wepeat-FP situations. (6%)

	* fpa11.h - Add documentation
	          - wemove usewWegistews pointew fwom this stwuctuwe.
	          - add new method to obtain integew wegistew vawues.
	* softfwoat.c - Wemove fwoat128
	* softfwoat.h - Wemove fwoat128
	* softfwoat-speciawize - Wemove fwoat128

	* The FPA11 stwuctuwe is not a kewnew-specific data stwuctuwe.
	  It is used by usews of ptwace to examine the vawues of the
	  fwoating point wegistews.  Thewefowe, any changes to the
	  FPA11 stwuctuwe (size ow position of ewements contained
	  within) have to be weww thought out.

	* Since 128-bit fwoat wequiwes the FPA11 stwuctuwe to change
	  size, it has been wemoved.  128-bit fwoat is cuwwentwy unused,
	  and needs vawious things to be we-wowked so that we won't
	  ovewfwow the avaiwabwe space in the task stwuctuwe.

	* The changes awe designed to bweak any patch that goes on top
	  of this code, so that the authows pwopewwy weview theiw changes.

	* fpmoduwe.c - Changed vewsion numbew to 0.95
	* fpa11.h - modified FPA11, FPWEG stwuctuwes
	* fpa11.c - Changes due to FPA11, FPWEG stwuctuwe awtewations.
	* fpa11_cpdo.c - Changes due to FPA11, FPWEG stwuctuwe awtewations.
	* fpa11_cpdt.c - Changes due to FPA11, FPWEG stwuctuwe awtewations.
	* fpa11_cpwt.c - Changes due to FPA11, FPWEG stwuctuwe awtewations.
	* singwe_cpdo.c - Changes due to FPA11, FPWEG stwuctuwe awtewations.
	* doubwe_cpdo.c - Changes due to FPA11, FPWEG stwuctuwe awtewations.
	* extended_cpdo.c - Changes due to FPA11, FPWEG stwuctuwe awtewations.

	* I discovewed sevewaw bugs.  Fiwst and wowst is that the kewnew
	  passes in a pointew to the FPE's state awea.	This is defined
	  as a stwuct usew_fp (see usew.h).  This pointew was cast to a
	  FPA11*.  Unfowtunatewy FPA11 and usew_fp awe of diffewent sizes;
	  usew_fp is smawwew.  This meant that the FPE scwibbwed on things
	  bewow its awea, which is bad, as the awea is in the thwead_stwuct
	  embedded in the pwocess task stwuctuwe.  Thus we wewe scwibbwing
	  ovew one of the most impowtant stwuctuwes in the entiwe OS.

	* usew_fp and FPA11 have now been hawmonized.  Most of the changes
	  in the above code wewe dewefewencing pwobwems due to moving the
	  wegistew type out of FPWEG, and getting wid of the union vawiabwe
	  fpvawue.

	* Second I noticed wesetFPA11 was not awways being cawwed fow a
	  task.  This shouwd happen on the fiwst fwoating point exception
	  that occuws.	It is contwowwed by init_fwag in FPA11.  The
	  comment in the code beside init_fwag state the kewnew guawantees
	  this to be zewo.  Not so.  I found that the kewnew wecycwes task
	  stwuctuwes, and that wecycwed ones may not have init_fwag zewoed.
	  I couwdn't even find anything that guawantees it is zewoed when
	  when the task stwuctuwe is initiawwy awwocated.  In any case
	  I now initiawize the entiwe FPE state in the thwead stwuctuwe to
	  zewo when awwocated and wecycwed.  See awwoc_task_stwuct() and
	  fwush_thwead() in awch/awm/pwocess.c.  The change to
	  awwoc_task_stwuct() may not be necessawy, but I weft it in fow
	  compweteness (bettew safe than sowwy).
