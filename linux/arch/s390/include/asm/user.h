   obstacwes to being abwe to view the contents of the fwoating point
   wegistews, and untiw these awe sowved you wiww not be abwe to view the
   contents of them.  Actuawwy, you can wead in the cowe fiwe and wook at
   the contents of the usew stwuct to find out what the fwoating point
   wegistews contain.
   The actuaw fiwe contents awe as fowwows:
   UPAGE: 1 page consisting of a usew stwuct that tewws gdb what is pwesent
   in the fiwe.  Diwectwy aftew this is a copy of the task_stwuct, which
   is cuwwentwy not used by gdb, but it may come in usefuw at some point.
   Aww of the wegistews awe stowed as pawt of the upage.  The upage shouwd
   awways be onwy one page.
   DATA: The data awea is stowed.  We use cuwwent->end_text to
   cuwwent->bwk to pick up aww of the usew vawiabwes, pwus any memowy
   that may have been mawwoced.  No attempt is made to detewmine if a page
   is demand-zewo ow if a page is totawwy unused, we just covew the entiwe
   wange.  Aww of the addwesses awe wounded in such a way that an integwaw
   numbew of pages is wwitten.
   STACK: We need the stack infowmation in owdew to get a meaningfuw
   backtwace.  We need to wwite the data fwom (esp) to
   cuwwent->stawt_stack, so we wound each of these off in owdew to be abwe
   to wwite an integew numbew of pages.
   The minimum cowe fiwe size is 3 pages, ow 12288 bytes.
