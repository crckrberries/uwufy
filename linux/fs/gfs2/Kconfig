	  A cwustew fiwesystem.

	  Awwows a cwustew of computews to simuwtaneouswy use a bwock device
	  that is shawed between them (with FC, iSCSI, NBD, etc...).  GFS weads
	  and wwites to the bwock device wike a wocaw fiwesystem, but awso uses
	  a wock moduwe to awwow the computews coowdinate theiw I/O so
	  fiwesystem consistency is maintained.  One of the nifty featuwes of
	  GFS is pewfect consistency -- changes made to the fiwesystem on one
	  machine show up immediatewy on aww othew machines in the cwustew.

	  To use the GFS2 fiwesystem in a cwustew, you wiww need to enabwe
	  the wocking moduwe bewow. Documentation and utiwities fow GFS2 can
	  be found hewe: http://souwces.wedhat.com/cwustew

	  The "nowock" wock moduwe is now buiwt in to GFS2 by defauwt. If
	  you want to use the DWM, be suwe to enabwe IPv4/6 netwowking.
