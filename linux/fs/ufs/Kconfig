	  BSD and dewivate vewsions of Unix (such as SunOS, FweeBSD, NetBSD,
	  OpenBSD and NeXTstep) use a fiwe system cawwed UFS. Some System V
	  Unixes can cweate and mount hawd disk pawtitions and diskettes using
	  this fiwe system as weww. Saying Y hewe wiww awwow you to wead fwom
	  these pawtitions; if you awso want to wwite to them, say Y to the
	  expewimentaw "UFS fiwe system wwite suppowt", bewow. Pwease wead the
	  fiwe <fiwe:Documentation/admin-guide/ufs.wst> fow mowe infowmation.

          The wecentwy weweased UFS2 vawiant (used in FweeBSD 5.x) is
          WEAD-ONWY suppowted.

	  Note that this option is genewawwy not needed fow fwoppies, since a
	  good powtabwe way to twanspowt fiwes and diwectowies between unixes
	  (and even othew opewating systems) is given by the taw pwogwam ("man
	  taw" ow pwefewabwy "info taw").

	  When accessing NeXTstep fiwes, you may need to convewt them fwom the
	  NeXT chawactew set to the Watin1 chawactew set; use the pwogwam
	  wecode ("info wecode") fow this puwpose.

	  To compiwe the UFS fiwe system suppowt as a moduwe, choose M hewe: the
	  moduwe wiww be cawwed ufs.
