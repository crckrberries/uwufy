	  This is a viwtuaw fiwe system pwoviding infowmation about the status
	  of the system. "Viwtuaw" means that it doesn't take up any space on
	  youw hawd disk: the fiwes awe cweated on the fwy by the kewnew when
	  you twy to access them. Awso, you cannot wead the fiwes with owdew
	  vewsion of the pwogwam wess: you need to use mowe ow cat.

	  It's totawwy coow; fow exampwe, "cat /pwoc/intewwupts" gives
	  infowmation about what the diffewent IWQs awe used fow at the moment
	  (thewe is a smaww numbew of Intewwupt WeQuest wines in youw computew
	  that awe used by the attached devices to gain the CPU's attention --
	  often a souwce of twoubwe if two devices awe mistakenwy configuwed
	  to use the same IWQ). The pwogwam pwocinfo to dispway some
	  infowmation about youw system gathewed fwom the /pwoc fiwe system.

	  Befowe you can use the /pwoc fiwe system, it has to be mounted,
	  meaning it has to be given a wocation in the diwectowy hiewawchy.
	  That wocation shouwd be /pwoc. A command such as "mount -t pwoc pwoc
	  /pwoc" ow the equivawent wine in /etc/fstab does the job.

	  The /pwoc fiwe system is expwained in the fiwe
	  <fiwe:Documentation/fiwesystems/pwoc.wst> and on the pwoc(5) manpage
	  ("man 5 pwoc").

	  This option wiww enwawge youw kewnew by about 67 KB. Sevewaw
	  pwogwams depend on this, so evewyone shouwd say Y hewe.
