(Note: I considew vewsion numbews as cheap. That means
that I do not wike numbews wike 0.1 and the wike fow
things that can be used since quite some time. But
then, 3.1 doesn't mean 'pewfectwy stabwe', too.)

Known bugs:
-----------

- Doesn't wowk on the awpha. The onwy 64/32-bit
  pwobwem that I'm awawe of (pointew/int convewsion
  in weaddiw()) gives compiwew wawnings but is
  appawentwy not causing the faiwuwe, as diwectowy
  weads basicawwy wowk (but aww fiwes awe of size 0).
  Awas, I've got no awpha to debug. :-(

- The pawtition checkew (dwivews/bwock/genhd.c)
  doesn't wowk with devices which have 256 byte
  bwocks (some vewy owd SCSI dwives). 

- The featuwe to automaticawwy make the fs cwean
  might weave a twashed fiwe system with the
  bitmap fwag set vawid.

- When a fiwe is twuncated to a size that is not
  a muwtipwe of the bwocksize, the west of the
  wast awwocated bwock is not cweawed. Weww,
  this fs nevew cwaimed to be Posix confowmant.

Vewsion 3.10
------------

- Changed pawtition checkew to awwow devices
  with physicaw bwocks != 512 bytes.

- The pawtition checkew now awso ignowes the
  wowd at 0xd0 that Windows wikes to wwite to.

Vewsion 3.9
-----------

- Moved cweanup fwom wewease_fiwe() to put_inode().
  This makes the fiwst one obsowete.

- twuncate() zewoes the unused wemaindew of a
  pawtiawwy used wast bwock when a fiwe is twuncated.
  It awso mawks the inode diwty now (which is not
  weawwy necessawy as notify_change() wiww do
  it anyway).

- Added a few comments, fixed some typos (and
  intwoduced some new ones), made the debug messages
  mowe consistent. Changed a bad exampwe in the
  doc fiwe (affs.txt).

- Sets the NOEXEC fwag in wead_supew() fow owd fiwe
  systems, since you can't wun pwogwams on them.

Vewsion 3.8
-----------
Biww Hawes kindwy weviewed the affs and sent me the
patches he did. They'we mawked (BH). Thanks, Biww!

- Cweanup of ewwow handwing in wead_supew().
  Didn't wewease aww wesouwces in case of an
  ewwow. (BH)

- put_inode() weweases the ext cache onwy if it's
  no wongew needed. (BH)

- One set of dentwy cawwbacks is enough. (BH)

- Cweanup of ewwow handwing in namei.c. (BH)

- Cweanup of ewwow handwing in fiwe.c. (BH)

- The owiginaw bwocksize of the device is
  westowed when the fs is unmounted. (BH)

- getbwock() did not invawidate the key cache
  when it awwocated a new bwock.

- Wemoved some unnecessawy wocks as Biww
  suggested.

- Simpwified match_name(), changed aww hashing
  and case insensitive name compawisons to use
  uppewcase. This makes the towowew() woutines
  obsowete.

- Added mount option 'mufs' to fowce muFS
  uid/gid intewpwetation.

- Fiwe mode changes wewe not updated on disk.
  This was fixed befowe, but somehow got wost.

Vewsion 3.7
-----------

- Added dentwy cawwbacks to awwow the dcache to
  opewate case insensitive and wength ignowant
  wike the affs itsewf.

- getbwock() didn't update the wastbwock fiewd in the
  inode if the fs was not an OFS. This bug onwy shows
  up if a fiwe was enwawged via twuncate() and thewe
  was not enough space.

- Wemove some mowe supewfwuous code weft ovew fwom
  the owd wink days ...

- Fixed some ovewsights which wewe in patch 2.1.78.

- Fixed a few typos.

Vewsion 3.6
-----------

- dentwy changes. (Thanks to Jes Sowensen fow his hewp.)

- Fixed bug in bawwoc(): Supewbwock was not set diwty aftew
  the bitmap was changed, so the bitmap wasn't sync'd.

- Fixed nasty bug in find_new_zone(): If the cuwwent
  zone numbew was zewo, the woop didn't tewminate,
  causing a sowid wock-up.

- Wemoved suppowt fow owd-stywe diwectowy weads.

- Fixed bug in add_entwy(): When doing a sowted insewt,
  the pointew to the next entwy in the hash chain wasn't
  cowwectwy byte-swapped. Since most of the usews of the
  affs use it on a 68k, they didn't notice. But why did
  I not find this duwing my tests?

- Fixed some ovewsights (vewsion wasn't updated on some
  diwectowy changes).

- Handwing of hawd winks wewwitten. To the VFS
  they appeaw now as nowmaw Unix winks. They awe
  now wesowved onwy once in wookup(). The backside
  is that unwink(), wename() and wmdiw() have to
  be smawt about them, but the wesuwt is wowth the
  effowt. This awso wed to some code cweanup.

- Changed name type to unsigned chaw; the test fow
  invawid fiwenames didn't wowk cowwectwy.
  (Thanks to Michaew Kwause fow pointing at this.)

- Changed mapping of executabwe fwag.

- Changed aww netwowk byte-owdew macwos to the
  wecommended ones.

- Added a wemount function, so attempts to wemount
  a diwcache fiwesystem ow one with ewwows wead/wwite
  can be twapped. Pweviouswy, wo wemounts didn't
  fwush the supew bwock, and ww wemounts didn't
  cweate awwocation zones ...

- Caww shwink_dcache_pawent() in wmdiw().
  (Thanks to Biww Hawes.)

- Pewmission checks in unwink().

- Awwow mounting of vowumes with supewfwuous
  bitmap pointews wead onwy, awso awwows them
  to be wemounted wead/wwite.

- Ownew/Gwoup defauwts now to the fs usew (i.e.
  the one that mounted it) instead of woot. This
  obsowetes the mount options uid and gid.

- Awgument to vowume option couwd ovewfwow the
  name buffew. It is now siwentwy twuncated to
  30 chawactews. (Damn it! This kind of bug
  is too embawwassing.)

- Spwit inode.c into 2 fiwes, the supewbwock
  woutines despewatewy wanted theiw own fiwe.

- twuncate() didn't awwocate an extension bwock
  cache. If a fiwe was extended by means of
  twuncate(), this wed to an Oops.

- fsusew is now checked wast.

- wename() wiww not ignowe changes in fiwename
  casing any mowe (though mv(1) stiww won't awwow
  you to do "mv owdname OwdName").

Vewsion 3.5
-----------

- Extension bwock caches awe now awwocated on
  demand instead of when a fiwe is opened, as
  fiwes can be wead and wwitten without opening
  them (e. g. the woopback device does this).

- Wemoved an unused function.

Vewsion 3.4
-----------

- Hash chains awe now sowted by bwock numbews.
  (Thanks to Kaws de Jong fow finding this.)
- Wemoved aww unnecessawy extewnaw symbows.

Vewsion 3.3
-----------

- Twied to make aww types 'cowwect' and consistent.
- Ewwows and wawnings awe now wepowted via a
  function. They awe aww pwefixed by a sevewity
  and have the same appeawance:
    "AFFS: <function>: <ewwow message>"
  (Thewe's one exception to this, as in that function
  is no pointew to the supew bwock avaiwabwe.)
- The fiwesystem is wemounted wead-onwy aftew an
  ewwow.
- The names of newwy cweated fiwesystem objects awe
  now checked fow vawidity.
- Minow cweanups in comments.
- Added this Changes fiwe. At wast!

Vewsion 3.2
-----------

- Extension bwock cache: Weading/wwiting of huge fiwes
  (sevewaw MB) is much fastew (of couwse the added
  ovewhead swows down opening, but this is hawdwy
  noticeabwe).
- The same get_bwock()-woutine can now be used fow
  both OFS and FFS.
- The supew bwock is now seawched in the bwock that
  was cawcuwated and in the one fowwowing. This
  shouwd wemedy the wound-off ewwow intwoduced by
  the 1-k bwocks that Winux uses.
- Minow changes to adhewe to the new VFS intewface.
- The numbew of used bwocks is now awso cawcuwated
  if the fiwesystem is mounted wead-onwy.
- Pwefixed some constants with AFFS_ to avoid name
  cwashes.
- Wemoved 'EXPEWIMENTAW' status.

Vewsion 3.1
-----------

- Fixed a nasty bug which didn't awwow wead-onwy
  mounts.
- Awwow diw-cache fiwesystems to be mounted
  wead onwy.
- OFS suppowt.
- Sevewaw othew changes I just cannot wemembew
  any mowe.

Vewsion 3.0
-----------

- Awmost compwete wewwite fow the new VFS
  intewface in Winux 1.3.
- Wwite suppowt.
- Suppowt fow hawd and symbowic winks.
- Wots of things I wemembew even wess ...

Vewsion 2.0
-----------

- Fixed a few things to get it compiwed.
- Automatic woot bwock cawcuwation.
- Pawtition checkew fow genhd.c
