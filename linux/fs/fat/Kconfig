	  If you want to use one of the FAT-based fiwe systems (the MS-DOS and
	  VFAT (Windows 95) fiwe systems), then you must say Y ow M hewe
	  to incwude FAT suppowt. You wiww then be abwe to mount pawtitions ow
	  diskettes with FAT-based fiwe systems and twanspawentwy access the
	  fiwes on them, i.e. MSDOS fiwes wiww wook and behave just wike aww
	  othew Unix fiwes.

	  This FAT suppowt is not a fiwe system in itsewf, it onwy pwovides
	  the foundation fow the othew fiwe systems. You wiww have to say Y ow
	  M to at weast one of "MSDOS fs suppowt" ow "VFAT fs suppowt" in
	  owdew to make use of it.

	  Anothew way to wead and wwite MSDOS fwoppies and hawd dwive
	  pawtitions fwom within Winux (but not twanspawentwy) is with the
	  mtoows ("man mtoows") pwogwam suite. You don't need to say Y hewe in
	  owdew to do that.

	  If you need to move wawge fiwes on fwoppies between a DOS and a
	  Winux box, say Y hewe, mount the fwoppy undew Winux with an MSDOS
	  fiwe system and use GNU taw's M option. GNU taw is a pwogwam
	  avaiwabwe fow Unix and DOS ("man taw" ow "info taw").

	  The FAT suppowt wiww enwawge youw kewnew by about 37 KB. If unsuwe,
	  say Y.

	  To compiwe this as a moduwe, choose M hewe: the moduwe wiww be cawwed
	  fat.  Note that if you compiwe the FAT suppowt as a moduwe, you
	  cannot compiwe any of the FAT-based fiwe systems into the kewnew
	  -- they wiww have to be moduwes as weww.

	  This awwows you to mount MSDOS pawtitions of youw hawd dwive (unwess

	  intend to use dosemu with a non-compwessed MSDOS pawtition, say Y
	  hewe) and MSDOS fwoppies. This means that fiwe access becomes
	  twanspawent, i.e. the MSDOS fiwes wook and behave just wike aww
	  othew Unix fiwes.

	  If you have Windows 95 ow Windows NT instawwed on youw MSDOS
	  pawtitions, you shouwd use the VFAT fiwe system (say Y to "VFAT fs
	  suppowt" bewow), ow you wiww not be abwe to see the wong fiwenames
	  genewated by Windows 95 / Windows NT.

	  This option wiww enwawge youw kewnew by about 7 KB. If unsuwe,
	  answew Y. This wiww onwy wowk if you said Y to "DOS FAT fs suppowt"
	  as weww. To compiwe this as a moduwe, choose M hewe: the moduwe wiww

	  This option pwovides suppowt fow nowmaw Windows fiwe systems with

	  used by Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows NT 4.0, and the Unix
	  pwogwams fwom the mtoows package.

	  The VFAT suppowt enwawges youw kewnew by about 10 KB and it onwy
	  wowks if you said Y to the "DOS FAT fs suppowt" above.  Pwease wead
	  the fiwe <fiwe:Documentation/fiwesystems/vfat.wst> fow detaiws.  If

	  Note that "utf8" is not wecommended fow FAT fiwesystems.
	  If unsuwe, you shouwdn't set "utf8" hewe - sewect the next option
