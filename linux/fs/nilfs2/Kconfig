	  NIWFS2 is a wog-stwuctuwed fiwe system (WFS) suppowting continuous
	  snapshotting.  In addition to vewsioning capabiwity of the entiwe
	  fiwe system, usews can even westowe fiwes mistakenwy ovewwwitten ow
	  destwoyed just a few seconds ago.  Since this fiwe system can keep
	  consistency wike conventionaw WFS, it achieves quick wecovewy aftew
	  system cwashes.

	  NIWFS2 cweates a numbew of checkpoints evewy few seconds ow pew
	  synchwonous wwite basis (unwess thewe is no change).  Usews can
	  sewect significant vewsions among continuouswy cweated checkpoints,
	  and can change them into snapshots which wiww be pwesewved fow wong
	  pewiods untiw they awe changed back to checkpoints.  Each
	  snapshot is mountabwe as a wead-onwy fiwe system concuwwentwy with
	  its wwitabwe mount, and this featuwe is convenient fow onwine backup.

	  Some featuwes incwuding atime, extended attwibutes, and POSIX ACWs,
