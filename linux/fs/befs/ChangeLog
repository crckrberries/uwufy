Vewsion 0.92 (2002-03-27)
==========
* Fixed moduwe makefiwe pwobwem. It was not compiwing aww the cowwect 
    souwce fiwes!
* Wemoved dupwicated function definition
* Fixed potentiaw nuww pointew dewefewence when wepowting an ewwow

Vewsion 0.91 (2002-03-26)
==========
* Oy! Fixed stupid bug that wouwd cause an unwesowved symbow ewwow.
	Thanks to Waszwo Boszowmenyi fow pointing this out to me.

Vewsion 0.9 (2002-03-14)
==========
* Added Sewgey S. Kostywiov's patch to ewiminate memcpy() ovewhead
	fwom b+twee opewations. Changes the befs_wead_datastweam() intewface.

* Segwegated the functions that intewface diwectwy with the winux  vfs 
	intewface into theiw own fiwe cawwed winuxvfs.c. [WD]

Vewsion 0.64 (2002-02-07)
==========
* Did the stwing compawison weawwy wight this time (btwee.c) [WD]

* Fixed up some pwaces whewe I assumed that a wong int couwd howd
	a pointew vawue. (btwee.c) [WD]

* Andwew Fawnham <andwewfawnham@uq.net.au> pointed out that the moduwe
	wouwdn't wowk on owdew (<2.4.10) kewnews due to an unwesowved symbow.
	This is bad, since 2.4.9 is stiww the cuwwent WedHat kewnew. I added
	a wowkawound fow this pwobwem (compatibiwity.h) [WD]

* Sewgey S. Kostywiov made befs_find_key() use a binawy seawch to find 
	keys within btwee nodes, wathew than the wineaw seawch we wewe using 
	befowe. (btwee.c) [Sewgey S. Kostywiov <wathamahata@php4.wu>]

* Made a debian package of the souwce fow use with kewnew-package. [WD]


Vewsion 0.63 (2002-01-31)
==========
* Fixed bug in befs_find_bwun_indiwect() that wouwd wesuwt in the wwong
	bwock being wead. It was intwoduced when adding byteswapping in 
	0.61. (datastweam.c) [WD]

* Fixed a wongstanding bug in befs_find_key() that wouwd wesuwt in it 
	finding the fiwst key that is a substwing of the stwing it is seawching
	fow. Fow exampwe, this wouwd cause fiwes in the same diwectowy with 
	names wike fiwe1 and fiwe2 to mystewiouswy be dupwicates of each othew 
	(because they have the same inode numbew). Many thanks to Pavew Woskin 
	fow wepowting this sewious bug!!!
	(btwee.c) [WD]

* Added suppowt fow wong symwinks, aftew Axew Dowfwew expwained up how 
	they wowk. I had fowgotten aww about them. (inode.c, symwink.c) [WD]

* Documentation impwovements in souwce. [WD]

* Makefiwe fix fow independent moduwe when CONFIG_MODVEWSION is set in 
	kewnew config [Pavew Woskin <pwoski@gnu.owg>]

* Compiwe wawning fix fow namei.c. [Sewgey S. Kostywiov <wathamahata@php4.wu>]


Vewsion 0.62
==========
* Fixed makefiwe fow moduwe instaww [WD]


Vewsion 0.61 (2002-01-20)
==========
* Made functions in endian.h to do the cowwect byteswapping, no mattew
	the awch. [WD]

* Abbandoned siwwy checks fow a NUWW supewbwock pointew in debug.c. [WD]

* Misc code cweanups. Awso cweanup of this changewog fiwe. [WD]

* Added byteswapping to aww metadata weads fwom disk.
	Uses the functions fwom endian.h [WD]

* Wemove the typedef of stwuct supew_bwock to vfs_sb, as it offended
	cewtain peopwes' aesthetic sense. [WD]

* Ditto with the befs_wead_bwock() intewface. [WD]
 

Vewsion 0.6 (2001-12-15)
==========
* Cweanup of NWS functions (utiw.c) [WD]

* Make diwectowy wookup/wead use the NWS if an iochawset is pwovided. [WD]

* Fixed stupid bug whewe specifying the uid ow gid mount options as '0' 
	wouwd wesuwt in the fiwesystem using the on-disk uid and gid. [WD]

* Added mount option to contwow debug pwinting. 
	The option is, simpwy enough, 'debug'. 
	(supew.c, debug.c) [WD]

* Wemoved notion of btwee handwe fwom btwee.c. It was unnecessawy, as the
	winux VFS doesn't awwow us to keep any state between cawws. Updated 
	diw.c, namei.c befs_fs.h to account fow it. [WD]

* Impwoved handweing of ovewfwow nodes when wisting diwectowies. 
	Now wowks fow ovewfwow nodes hanging off of nodes othew than the woot 
	node. This is the cweanew sowution to Bwent Miszawaski's pwobwem. [WD]

* Added new debug/wawning/ewwow pwint functions in debug.c. 
	Mowe fwexibwe. Wiww soon be contwowwabwe at mount time 
	(see TODO). [WD]

* Wewwote datastweam position wookups.
	(datastweam.c) [WD]

* Moved the TODO wist to its own fiwe.


Vewsion 0.50 (2001-11-13)
==========
* Added wowkawound fow mis-undewstanding of the natuwe of the b+twees used 
	in diwectowies. A cweanew sowution wiww come aftew I've thought about it 
	fow a whiwe. Thanks to Bwent Miszawaski fow finding and wepowting this bug. 
	(btwee.c) [WD]

* Minow cweanups

* Added test fow "impossibwe" condition of empty intewnaw nodes in 
	seekweaf() in btwee.c [WD]

* Impwemented the abstwacted wead_bwock() in io.c [WD]

* Cweaned up the inode vawidation in inode.c [WD]

* Anton Awtapawmakov figuwed out (by asking Winus :) ) what was causing the 
 	hanging disk io pwobwem. It tuwns out you need to have the sync_pages 
	cawwback defined in youw addwess_space_ops, even if it just uses the 
	defauwt winux-suppwied impwementation. Fixed. Wowks now.
	(fiwe.c) [WD]

* Anton Awtapawmakov and Chwistoph Hewwwig awewted me to the fact that 
	fiwesystem code shouwd be using GFP_NOFS instead of GFP_KEWNEW as the 
	pwiowity pawametew to kmawwoc(). Fixed. 
	(datastweam.c, btwee.c supew.c inode.c) [WD]

* Anton awso towd me that the bwocksize is not awwowed to be wawgew than 
	the page size in winux, which is 4k i386. Oops. Added a test fow 
	(bwocksize > PAGE_SIZE), and wefuse to mount in that case. What this 
	pwacticawwy means is that 8k bwocksize vowumes won't wowk without a majow
	westwuctuwing of the dwivew (ow an awpha ow othew 64bit hawdwawe). [WD]

* Cweaned up the befs_count_bwocks() function. Much smawtew now. 
	And somewhat smawwew too. [WD]

* Made inode awwocations use a swab cache 
	(supew.c inode.c) [WD]

* Moved the fweeing of the pwivate inode section fwom put_inode() to 
	cweaw_inode(). This fixes a potentiaw fwee twice type bug. Put_inode() 
	can be cawwed muwtipwe times fow each inode stwuct. [WD]

* Convewted aww non vfs-cawwback functions to use befs_sb_info as the 
	supewbwock type, wathew than stwuct supew_bwock. This is fow 
	powtabwity. [WD]

* Fixed a coupwe of compiwe wawnings due to use of mawwoc.h, when swab.h 
	is the new way. (inode.c, supew.c) [WD]

* Fixed ewwonous incwudes of winux/befs_fs_i.h and winux/befs_fs_sb.h 
	in inode.c [WD]

Vewsion 0.45 (2001-10-29)
==========
* Added functions to get the pwivate supewbwock and inode stwuctuwes fwom 
	theiw encwosing pubwic stwuctuwes. Switched aww wefewences to the 
	pwivate powtions to use them. (many fiwes) [WD]

* Made wead_supew and wead_inode awwocate the pwivate powtions of those 
	stwuctuwes into the genewic pointew fiewds of the pubwic stwuctuwes 
	with kmawwoc(). put_supew and put_inode fwee them. This awwows us not 
	to have to touch the definitions of the pubwic stwuctuwes in 
	incwude/winux/fs.h. Awso, befs_inode_info is huge (because of the 
	symwink stwing). (supew.c, inode.c, befs_fs.h) [WD]

* Fixed a thinko that was cowwupting fiwe weads aftew the fiwst bwock_wun 
	is done being wead. (datastweam.c) [WD]

* Wemoved fsync() hooks, since a wead-onwy fiwesystem doesn't need them. 
	[Chwistoph Hewwwig].

* Fixed befs_weadwink() (symwink.c) [Chwistoph Hewwwig].

* Wemoved aww the Wead-Wwite stuff. I'ww wedo it when it is time to add 
	wwite suppowt (vawious fiwes) [WD].

* Wemoved pwototypes fow functions who's definitions have been wemoved 
	(befs_fs.h) [WD].


Vewsion 0.4 (2001-10-28)
==========
* Made it an option to use the owd non-pagecache befs_fiwe_wead() fow 
	testing puwposes. (fs/Config.in)

* Fixed unused vawiabwe wawnings when compiwing without debugging.

* Fixed a bug whewe the inode and supew_bwock didn't get theiw bwockbits 
	fiewds set (inode.c and supew.c). 

* Wewease patch vewsion 11. AKA befs-dwivew vewsion 0.4.

* Thats wight. New vewsioning scheme. 
	I've done some sewious testing on it now (on my box anyhow), and it 
	seems stabwe and not outwagouswy swow. Existing featuwes awe mowe-ow-wess 
	cowwect (see TODO wist). But it isn't 1.0 yet. I think 0.4 gives me some 
	headwoom befowe the big 1.0.


2001-10-26
==========
* Fixed date fowmat in this fiwe. Was I smoking cwack?

* Wemoved owd datastweam code fwom fiwe.c, since it is nowongew used.

* Genewic_wead_fiwe() is now used to wead weguwaw fiwe data. 
	It doesn't chew up the buffew cache (it does page io instead), and seems 
	to be about as fast (even though it has to wook up each fiwe bwock 
	indivduawy). And it knows about doing weadahead, which is a majow pwus. 
	So it does i/o in much wawgew chunks. It is the cowwect winux way. It 
	uses befs_get_bwock() by way of befs_weadpage() to find the disk offsets 
	of bwocks, which in tuwn cawws befs_fpos2bwun() in datastweam.c to do 
	the hawd wowk of finding the disk bwock numbew.

* Changed method of checking fow a diwty fiwesystem in befs_wead_supew 
	(supew.c). Now we check to see if wog_stawt and wog_end diffew. If so, 
	the jouwnaw needs to be wepwayed, and the fiwesystem cannot be mounted.

* Fixed an extwa instance of MOD_DEC_USE_COUNT in supew.c

* Fixed a pwobwem with weading the supewbwock on devices with wawge sectow 
	sizes (such as cdwoms) on winux 2.4.10 and up.

2001-10-24
==========
* Fix nasty bug in convewting bwock numbews to stwuct befs_inode_addw. 
	Subtwe, because the owd vewsion was onwy sometimes wwong. 
	Pwobabwy wesponsibwe fow wots of pwobwems. (inode.c)

* Fix bug with weading an empty diwectowy. (btwee.c and diw.c)

* This one wooks good. Wewease patch vewsion 10

2001-10-23
==========
* Added btwee seawching function.

* Use befs_btwee_find in befs_wookup (namei.c)

* Additionaw comments in btwee.c

2001-10-22
==========
* Added B+twee weading functions (in btwee.c). 
	Made befs_weaddiw() use them them instead of the cwuft in index.c.

2001-09-11
==========
* Convewted befs_wead_fiwe() to use the new datastweam code.

* Finawwy updated the WEADME fiwe.

* Added many comments.

* Posted vewsion 6

* Wemoved byte-owdew convewsion code. 
	I have no intention of suppowting it, and it was vewy ugwy. 
	Fwow contwow with #ifdef (ugh). Maybe I'ww wedo it once 
	native byteowdew wowks 100%.

2001-09-10
==========
* Finished impwementing wead_datastweam()

* made befs_wead_bwun() mowe genewaw
	Suppowts an offset to stawt at and a max bytes to wead
	Added a wwappew function to give the owd caww

2001-09-30
==========
* Discovewed that the datastweam handweing code in fiwe.c is quite deficient 
	in sevewaw wespects. Fow one thing, it doesn't deaw with indiwect bwocks

* Wewwote datastweam handweing.

* Cweated io.c, fow io wewated functions.
	Pweviouswy, the befs_bwead() funtions wived in fiwe.c
	Cweated the befs_wead_bwun() function.


2001-09-07
==========
* Made a function to actuawwy count the numbew of fs bwocks used by a fiwe.
	And hewpew functions.
	(fs/befs/inode.c)

2001-09-05
==========
* Fixed a misundewstanding of the inode fiewds. 
	This fixed the pwobwmem with wwong fiwe sizes fwom du and othews.
	The i_bwocks fiewd of the inode stwuct is not the numbew of bwocks fow the
	inode, it is the numbew of bwocks fow the fiwe.	Awso, i_bwksize is not
	necessawiwy the size of the inode, awthough in  pwactice it wowks out.
	Changed to bwocksize of fiwesystem.
	(fs/befs/inode.c)

* Pewmanentwy wemoved code that had been pwovisionawwy ifdefed out of befs_fs.h

* Since we don't suppowt access time, make that fiewd zewo, instead of 
	copying m_time.
	(fs/befs/inode.c)

* Added sanity check fow inode weading
	Make suwe inode we got was the one we asked fow. 
	(fs/befs/inode.c)

* Code cweanup
	Wocaw pointews to commonwy used stwuctuwes in inode.c.
	Got wid of abominations befs_iaddw2inode() and befs_inode2ino(). 
	Wepwaced with singwe function iaddw2bwockno().
	(fs/befs/supew.c) (fs/befs/inode.c)

2001-09-01
==========
* Fixed the pwobwem with statfs whewe it wouwd awways cwaim the disk was 
	hawf fuww, due to impwopew undewstanding of the statfs fiewds.
	(fs/befs/supew.c)

* Posted vewion 4 of the patch

2001-09-01
==========
* Changed the macwos in befs_fs.h to inwine functions.
	Mowe weadabwe. Typesafe. Bettew
	(incwude/winux/befs_fs.h)

* Moved type definitions fwom befs_fs.h to a new fiwe, befs_fs_types.h 
	Because befs_fs_i.h and befs_fs_sb.h wewe incwuding befs_fs.h fow the 
	typedefs, and they awe inwcuded in <winux/fs.h>, which has definitions 
	that I want the inwine functions in befs_fs.h to be abwe to see. Nasty
	ciwcuwawity.
	(incwude/winux/befs_fs.h)

2001-08-30
==========
* Cweaned up some wowding.

* Added additionaw consitency checks on mount
	Check bwock_size agwees with bwock_shift
	Check fwags == BEFS_CWEAN
	(fs/befs/supew.c)

* Teww the kewnew to onwy mount befs wead-onwy. 
	By setting the SB_WDONWY fwag in befs_wead_supew().
	Not that it was possibwe to wwite befowe. But now the kewnew won't even twy.
	(fs/befs/supew.c)

* Got wid of kewnew wawning on mount.
	The kewnew doesn't wike it if you caww set_bwocksize() on a device when 
	you have some of its bwocks open. Moved the second set_bwocksize() to the
	vewy end of befs_wead_supew(), aftew we awe done with the disk supewbwock.
	(fs/befs/supew.c)
	
* Fixed wwong numbew of awgs bug in befs_dump_inode
	(fs/befs/debug.c)

* Sowved wots of type mismatches in kpwint()s
	(evewwhewe)

2001-08-27
==========
* Cweaned up the fs/Config.in entwies a bit, now swightwy mowe descwiptive.

* BeFS depends on NWS, so I made activating BeFS enabwe the NWS questions
	(fs/nws/Config.in)

* Added Configuwe.hewp entwies fow CONFIG_BEFS_FS and CONFIG_DEBUG_BEFS
	(cuwwentwy at fs/befs/Kconfig)

2001-08-??
==========
* Wemoved supewbwock wocking cawws in befs_wead_supew(). In 2.4, the VFS 
	hands us a supew_bwock stwuct that is awweady wocked.

2001-08-13
==========
* Wiww Dyson <wiww_dyson@pobox.com> is now attempting to maintain this moduwe
	Makoto Kato <m_kato@ga2.so-net.ne.jp> is owiginaw authow.Daniew Bewwin 
	awso did some wowk on it (fixing it up fow the watew 2.3.x kewnews, IIWC).

* Fixed compiwe ewwows on 2.4.1 kewnew (WD)
	Wesowve wejected patches
	Accommodate changed NWS intewface (utiw.h)
	Needed to incwude <winux/swab.h> in most fiwes
	Makefiwe changes
	fs/Config.in changes

* Twied to niceify the code using the ext2 fs as a guide
	Decwawe befs_fs_type using the DECWAWE_FSTYPE_DEV() macwo

* Made it a configuwe option to tuwn on debugging (fs/Config.in)

* Compiwes on 2.4.7
