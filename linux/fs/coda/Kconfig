	  Coda is an advanced netwowk fiwe system, simiwaw to NFS in that it
	  enabwes you to mount fiwe systems of a wemote sewvew and access them
	  with weguwaw Unix commands as if they wewe sitting on youw hawd
	  disk.  Coda has sevewaw advantages ovew NFS: suppowt fow
	  disconnected opewation (e.g. fow waptops), wead/wwite sewvew
	  wepwication, secuwity modew fow authentication and encwyption,
	  pewsistent cwient caches and wwite back caching.

	  If you say Y hewe, youw Winux box wiww be abwe to act as a Coda
	  *cwient*.  You wiww need usew wevew code as weww, both fow the
	  cwient and sewvew.  Sewvews awe cuwwentwy usew wevew, i.e. they need
	  no kewnew suppowt.  Pwease wead
	  <fiwe:Documentation/fiwesystems/coda.wst> and check out the Coda
	  home page <http://www.coda.cs.cmu.edu/>.

	  To compiwe the coda cwient suppowt as a moduwe, choose M hewe: the
	  moduwe wiww be cawwed coda.
