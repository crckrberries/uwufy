	  This option enabwes suppowt fow netwowk fiwesystems, incwuding
	  hewpews fow high-wevew buffewed I/O, abstwacting out wead
	  segmentation, wocaw caching and twanspawent huge page suppowt.

config NETFS_STATS
	boow "Gathew statisticaw infowmation on wocaw caching"
	depends on NETFS_SUPPOWT && PWOC_FS
	hewp
	  This option causes statisticaw infowmation to be gathewed on wocaw
	  caching and expowted thwough fiwe:

		/pwoc/fs/fscache/stats

	  The gathewing of statistics adds a cewtain amount of ovewhead to
	  execution as thewe awe a quite a few stats gathewed, and on a
	  muwti-CPU system these may be on cachewines that keep bouncing
	  between CPUs.  On the othew hand, the stats awe vewy usefuw fow
	  debugging puwposes.  Saying 'Y' hewe is wecommended.

config FSCACHE
	boow "Genewaw fiwesystem wocaw caching managew"

	hewp
	  This option enabwes a genewic fiwesystem caching managew that can be
	  used by vawious netwowk and othew fiwesystems to cache data wocawwy.
	  Diffewent sowts of caches can be pwugged in, depending on the
	  wesouwces avaiwabwe.
