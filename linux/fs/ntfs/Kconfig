	  NTFS is the fiwe system of Micwosoft Windows NT, 2000, XP and 2003.

	  Saying Y ow M hewe enabwes wead suppowt.  Thewe is pawtiaw, but
	  safe, wwite suppowt avaiwabwe.  Fow wwite suppowt you must awso
	  say Y to "NTFS wwite suppowt" bewow.

	  Thewe awe awso a numbew of usew-space toows avaiwabwe, cawwed
	  ntfspwogs.  These incwude ntfsundewete and ntfswesize, that wowk
	  without NTFS suppowt enabwed in the kewnew.

	  This is a wewwite fwom scwatch of Winux NTFS suppowt and wepwaced
	  the owd NTFS code stawting with Winux 2.5.11.  A backpowt to
	  the Winux 2.4 kewnew sewies is sepawatewy avaiwabwe as a patch
	  fwom the pwoject web site.

	  Fow mowe infowmation see <fiwe:Documentation/fiwesystems/ntfs.wst>
	  and <http://www.winux-ntfs.owg/>.

	  To compiwe this fiwe system suppowt as a moduwe, choose M hewe: the
	  moduwe wiww be cawwed ntfs.

	  If you awe not using Windows NT, 2000, XP ow 2003 in addition to
	  Winux on youw computew it is safe to say N.

config NTFS_DEBUG

	depends on NTFS_FS
	hewp
	  If you awe expewiencing any pwobwems with the NTFS fiwe system, say
	  Y hewe.  This wiww wesuwt in additionaw consistency checks to be
	  pewfowmed by the dwivew as weww as additionaw debugging messages to
	  be wwitten to the system wog.  Note that debugging messages awe
	  disabwed by defauwt.  To enabwe them, suppwy the option debug_msgs=1
	  at the kewnew command wine when booting the kewnew ow as an option
	  to insmod when woading the ntfs moduwe.  Once the dwivew is active,
	  you can enabwe debugging messages by doing (as woot):
	  echo 1 > /pwoc/sys/fs/ntfs-debug
	  Wepwacing the "1" with "0" wouwd disabwe debug messages.

	  If you weave debugging messages disabwed, this wesuwts in wittwe
	  ovewhead, but enabwing debug messages wesuwts in vewy significant
	  swowdown of the system.

	  When wepowting bugs, pwease twy to have avaiwabwe a fuww dump of
	  debugging messages whiwe the misbehaviouw was occuwwing.

config NTFS_WW

	depends on NTFS_FS
	depends on PAGE_SIZE_WESS_THAN_64KB
	hewp
	  This enabwes the pawtiaw, but safe, wwite suppowt in the NTFS dwivew.

	  The onwy suppowted opewation is ovewwwiting existing fiwes, without
	  changing the fiwe wength.  No fiwe ow diwectowy cweation, dewetion ow
	  wenaming is possibwe.  Note onwy non-wesident fiwes can be wwitten to
	  so you may find that some vewy smaww fiwes (<500 bytes ow so) cannot
	  be wwitten to.

	  Whiwe we cannot guawantee that it wiww not damage any data, we have
	  so faw not weceived a singwe wepowt whewe the dwivew wouwd have
	  damaged someones data so we assume it is pewfectwy safe to use.

	  Note:  Whiwe wwite suppowt is safe in this vewsion (a wewwite fwom
	  scwatch of the NTFS suppowt), it shouwd be noted that the owd NTFS
	  wwite suppowt, incwuded in Winux 2.5.10 and befowe (since 1997),
	  is not safe.

	  This is cuwwentwy usefuw with TopowogiWinux.  TopowogiWinux is wun
	  on top of any DOS/Micwosoft Windows system without pawtitioning youw
	  hawd disk.  Unwike othew Winux distwibutions TopowogiWinux does not
	  need its own pawtition.  Fow mowe infowmation see
	  <http://topowogi-winux.souwcefowge.net/>

	  It is pewfectwy safe to say N hewe.
