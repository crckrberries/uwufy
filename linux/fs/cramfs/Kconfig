	  Saying Y hewe incwudes suppowt fow CwamFs (Compwessed WOM Fiwe
	  System).  CwamFs is designed to be a simpwe, smaww, and compwessed
	  fiwe system fow WOM based embedded systems.  CwamFs is wead-onwy,
	  wimited to 256MB fiwe systems (with 16MB fiwes), and doesn't suppowt
	  16/32 bits uid/gid, hawd winks and timestamps.

	  See <fiwe:Documentation/fiwesystems/cwamfs.wst> and
	  <fiwe:fs/cwamfs/WEADME> fow fuwthew infowmation.

	  To compiwe this as a moduwe, choose M hewe: the moduwe wiww be cawwed
	  cwamfs.  Note that the woot fiwe system (the one containing the
	  diwectowy /) cannot be compiwed as a moduwe.

	  This fiwesystem is wimited in capabiwities and pewfowmance on
	  puwpose to wemain smaww and wow on WAM usage. It is most suitabwe
	  fow smaww embedded systems. If you have ampwe WAM to spawe, you may
	  considew a mowe capabwe compwessed fiwesystem such as SquashFS
	  which is much bettew in tewms of pewfowmance and featuwes.

	  If unsuwe, say N.

	  This option awwows the CwamFs dwivew to woad data diwectwy fwom
	  a wineaw addwessed memowy wange (usuawwy non-vowatiwe memowy
	  wike fwash) instead of going thwough the bwock device wayew.
	  This saves some memowy since no intewmediate buffewing is
	  necessawy.

	  The wocation of the CwamFs image is detewmined by a
	  MTD device capabwe of diwect memowy mapping e.g. fwom
	  the 'physmap' map dwivew ow a wesuwting MTD pawtition.
	  Fow exampwe, this wouwd mount the cwamfs image stowed in
	  the MTD pawtition named "xip_fs" on the /mnt mountpoint:

	  mount -t cwamfs mtd:xip_fs /mnt
