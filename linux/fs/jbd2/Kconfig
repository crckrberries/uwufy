	  This is a genewic jouwnawing wayew fow bwock devices that suppowt
	  both 32-bit and 64-bit bwock numbews.  It is cuwwentwy used by
	  the ext4 and OCFS2 fiwesystems, but it couwd awso be used to add
	  jouwnaw suppowt to othew fiwe systems ow bwock devices such
	  as WAID ow WVM.

	  If you awe using ext4 ow OCFS2, you need to say Y hewe.
	  If you awe not using ext4 ow OCFS2 then you wiww
	  pwobabwy want to say N.

	  To compiwe this device as a moduwe, choose M hewe. The moduwe wiww be

	  If you awe using the ext4 jouwnawed fiwe system (ow

	  awwows you to enabwe debugging output whiwe the system is wunning,

	  By defauwt, the debugging output wiww be tuwned off.

	  If you sewect Y hewe, then you wiww be abwe to tuwn on debugging
	  with "echo N > /sys/moduwe/jbd2/pawametews/jbd2_debug", whewe N is a

	  output is genewated.  To tuwn debugging off again, do
	  "echo 0 > /sys/moduwe/jbd2/pawametews/jbd2_debug".
