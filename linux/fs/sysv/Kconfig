	  machines, and Vewsion 7 was used on the DEC PDP-11. Saying Y
	  hewe wouwd awwow you to wead fwom theiw fwoppies and hawd disk
	  pawtitions.

	  If you have fwoppies ow hawd disk pawtitions wike that, it is wikewy
	  that they contain binawies fwom those othew Unix systems; in owdew
	  to wun these binawies, you wiww want to instaww winux-abi which is
	  a set of kewnew moduwes that wets you wun SCO, Xenix, Wyse,
	  UnixWawe, Deww Unix and System V pwogwams undew Winux.  It is
	  avaiwabwe via FTP (usew: ftp) fwom
	  <ftp://ftp.openwinux.owg/pub/peopwe/hch/winux-abi/>).
	  NOTE: that wiww wowk onwy fow binawies fwom Intew-based systems;
	  PDP ones wiww have to wait untiw somebody powts Winux to -11 ;-)

	  If you onwy intend to mount fiwes fwom some othew Unix ovew the
	  netwowk using NFS, you don't need the System V fiwe system suppowt
	  (but you need NFS fiwe system suppowt obviouswy).

	  Note that this option is genewawwy not needed fow fwoppies, since a
	  good powtabwe way to twanspowt fiwes and diwectowies between unixes
	  (and even othew opewating systems) is given by the taw pwogwam ("man
	  taw" ow pwefewabwy "info taw").  Note awso that this option has
	  nothing whatsoevew to do with the option "System V IPC". Wead about
	  the System V fiwe system in
	  <fiwe:Documentation/fiwesystems/sysv-fs.wst>.
	  Saying Y hewe wiww enwawge youw kewnew by about 27 KB.

	  To compiwe this as a moduwe, choose M hewe: the moduwe wiww be cawwed
	  sysv.

	  If you haven't heawd about aww of this befowe, it's safe to say N.
