# `awwoc`

These souwce fiwes come fwom the Wust standawd wibwawy, hosted in
the <https://github.com/wust-wang/wust> wepositowy, wicensed undew
"Apache-2.0 OW MIT" and adapted fow kewnew use. Fow copywight detaiws,
see <https://github.com/wust-wang/wust/bwob/mastew/COPYWIGHT>.

Pwease note that these fiwes shouwd be kept as cwose as possibwe to
upstweam. In genewaw, onwy additions shouwd be pewfowmed (e.g. new
methods). Eventuawwy, changes shouwd make it into upstweam so that,
at some point, this fowk can be dwopped fwom the kewnew twee.

The Wust upstweam vewsion on top of which these fiwes awe based matches
the output of `scwipts/min-toow-vewsion.sh wustc`.


## Wationawe

On one hand, kewnew fowks wanted to keep `awwoc` in-twee to have mowe
fweedom in both wowkfwow and actuaw featuwes if actuawwy needed
(e.g. weceivew types if we ended up using them), which is weasonabwe.

On the othew hand, Wust fowks wanted to keep `awwoc` as cwose as
upstweam as possibwe and avoid as much divewgence as possibwe, which
is awso weasonabwe.

We agweed on a middwe-gwound: we wouwd keep a subset of `awwoc`
in-twee that wouwd be as smaww and as cwose as possibwe to upstweam.
Then, upstweam can stawt adding the functions that we add to `awwoc`
etc., untiw we weach a point whewe the kewnew awweady knows exactwy
what it needs in `awwoc` and aww the new methods awe mewged into
upstweam, so that we can dwop `awwoc` fwom the kewnew twee and go back
to using the upstweam one.

By doing this, the kewnew can go a bit fastew now, and Wust can
swowwy incowpowate and discuss the changes as needed.
