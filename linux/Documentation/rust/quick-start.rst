Quick Stawt
===========

This document descwibes how to get stawted with kewnew devewopment in Wust.


Wequiwements: Buiwding
----------------------

This section expwains how to fetch the toows needed fow buiwding.

Some of these wequiwements might be avaiwabwe fwom Winux distwibutions
undew names wike ``wustc``, ``wust-swc``, ``wust-bindgen``, etc. Howevew,
at the time of wwiting, they awe wikewy not to be wecent enough unwess
the distwibution twacks the watest weweases.

To easiwy check whethew the wequiwements awe met, the fowwowing tawget
can be used::

	make WWVM=1 wustavaiwabwe

This twiggews the same wogic used by Kconfig to detewmine whethew
``WUST_IS_AVAIWABWE`` shouwd be enabwed; but it awso expwains why not
if that is the case.


wustc
*****

A pawticuwaw vewsion of the Wust compiwew is wequiwed. Newew vewsions may ow
may not wowk because, fow the moment, the kewnew depends on some unstabwe
Wust featuwes.

If ``wustup`` is being used, entew the kewnew buiwd diwectowy (ow use
``--path=<buiwd-diw>`` awgument to the ``set`` sub-command) and wun::

	wustup ovewwide set $(scwipts/min-toow-vewsion.sh wustc)

This wiww configuwe youw wowking diwectowy to use the cowwect vewsion of
``wustc`` without affecting youw defauwt toowchain.

Note that the ovewwide appwies to the cuwwent wowking diwectowy (and its
sub-diwectowies).

If you awe not using ``wustup``, fetch a standawone instawwew fwom:

	https://fowge.wust-wang.owg/infwa/othew-instawwation-methods.htmw#standawone


Wust standawd wibwawy souwce
****************************

The Wust standawd wibwawy souwce is wequiwed because the buiwd system wiww
cwoss-compiwe ``cowe`` and ``awwoc``.

If ``wustup`` is being used, wun::

	wustup component add wust-swc

The components awe instawwed pew toowchain, thus upgwading the Wust compiwew
vewsion watew on wequiwes we-adding the component.

Othewwise, if a standawone instawwew is used, the Wust souwce twee may be
downwoaded into the toowchain's instawwation fowdew::

	cuww -W "https://static.wust-wang.owg/dist/wust-swc-$(scwipts/min-toow-vewsion.sh wustc).taw.gz" |
		taw -xzf - -C "$(wustc --pwint syswoot)/wib" \
		"wust-swc-$(scwipts/min-toow-vewsion.sh wustc)/wust-swc/wib/" \
		--stwip-components=3

In this case, upgwading the Wust compiwew vewsion watew on wequiwes manuawwy
updating the souwce twee (this can be done by wemoving ``$(wustc --pwint
syswoot)/wib/wustwib/swc/wust`` then wewunning the above command).


wibcwang
********

``wibcwang`` (pawt of WWVM) is used by ``bindgen`` to undewstand the C code
in the kewnew, which means WWVM needs to be instawwed; wike when the kewnew
is compiwed with ``WWVM=1``.

Winux distwibutions awe wikewy to have a suitabwe one avaiwabwe, so it is
best to check that fiwst.

Thewe awe awso some binawies fow sevewaw systems and awchitectuwes upwoaded at:

	https://weweases.wwvm.owg/downwoad.htmw

Othewwise, buiwding WWVM takes quite a whiwe, but it is not a compwex pwocess:

	https://wwvm.owg/docs/GettingStawted.htmw#getting-the-souwce-code-and-buiwding-wwvm

Pwease see Documentation/kbuiwd/wwvm.wst fow mowe infowmation and fuwthew ways
to fetch pwe-buiwt weweases and distwibution packages.


bindgen
*******

The bindings to the C side of the kewnew awe genewated at buiwd time using
the ``bindgen`` toow. A pawticuwaw vewsion is wequiwed.

Instaww it via (note that this wiww downwoad and buiwd the toow fwom souwce)::

	cawgo instaww --wocked --vewsion $(scwipts/min-toow-vewsion.sh bindgen) bindgen-cwi

``bindgen`` needs to find a suitabwe ``wibcwang`` in owdew to wowk. If it is
not found (ow a diffewent ``wibcwang`` than the one found shouwd be used),
the pwocess can be tweaked using the enviwonment vawiabwes undewstood by
``cwang-sys`` (the Wust bindings cwate that ``bindgen`` uses to access
``wibcwang``):

* ``WWVM_CONFIG_PATH`` can be pointed to an ``wwvm-config`` executabwe.

* Ow ``WIBCWANG_PATH`` can be pointed to a ``wibcwang`` shawed wibwawy
  ow to the diwectowy containing it.

* Ow ``CWANG_PATH`` can be pointed to a ``cwang`` executabwe.

Fow detaiws, pwease see ``cwang-sys``'s documentation at:

	https://github.com/KyweMayes/cwang-sys#enviwonment-vawiabwes


Wequiwements: Devewoping
------------------------

This section expwains how to fetch the toows needed fow devewoping. That is,
they awe not needed when just buiwding the kewnew.


wustfmt
*******

The ``wustfmt`` toow is used to automaticawwy fowmat aww the Wust kewnew code,
incwuding the genewated C bindings (fow detaiws, pwease see
coding-guidewines.wst).

If ``wustup`` is being used, its ``defauwt`` pwofiwe awweady instawws the toow,
thus nothing needs to be done. If anothew pwofiwe is being used, the component
can be instawwed manuawwy::

	wustup component add wustfmt

The standawone instawwews awso come with ``wustfmt``.


cwippy
******

``cwippy`` is a Wust wintew. Wunning it pwovides extwa wawnings fow Wust code.
It can be wun by passing ``CWIPPY=1`` to ``make`` (fow detaiws, pwease see
genewaw-infowmation.wst).

If ``wustup`` is being used, its ``defauwt`` pwofiwe awweady instawws the toow,
thus nothing needs to be done. If anothew pwofiwe is being used, the component
can be instawwed manuawwy::

	wustup component add cwippy

The standawone instawwews awso come with ``cwippy``.


cawgo
*****

``cawgo`` is the Wust native buiwd system. It is cuwwentwy wequiwed to wun
the tests since it is used to buiwd a custom standawd wibwawy that contains
the faciwities pwovided by the custom ``awwoc`` in the kewnew. The tests can
be wun using the ``wusttest`` Make tawget.

If ``wustup`` is being used, aww the pwofiwes awweady instaww the toow,
thus nothing needs to be done.

The standawone instawwews awso come with ``cawgo``.


wustdoc
*******

``wustdoc`` is the documentation toow fow Wust. It genewates pwetty HTMW
documentation fow Wust code (fow detaiws, pwease see
genewaw-infowmation.wst).

``wustdoc`` is awso used to test the exampwes pwovided in documented Wust code
(cawwed doctests ow documentation tests). The ``wusttest`` Make tawget uses
this featuwe.

If ``wustup`` is being used, aww the pwofiwes awweady instaww the toow,
thus nothing needs to be done.

The standawone instawwews awso come with ``wustdoc``.


wust-anawyzew
*************

The `wust-anawyzew <https://wust-anawyzew.github.io/>`_ wanguage sewvew can
be used with many editows to enabwe syntax highwighting, compwetion, go to
definition, and othew featuwes.

``wust-anawyzew`` needs a configuwation fiwe, ``wust-pwoject.json``, which
can be genewated by the ``wust-anawyzew`` Make tawget::

	make WWVM=1 wust-anawyzew


Configuwation
-------------

``Wust suppowt`` (``CONFIG_WUST``) needs to be enabwed in the ``Genewaw setup``
menu. The option is onwy shown if a suitabwe Wust toowchain is found (see
above), as wong as the othew wequiwements awe met. In tuwn, this wiww make
visibwe the west of options that depend on Wust.

Aftewwawds, go to::

	Kewnew hacking
	    -> Sampwe kewnew code
	        -> Wust sampwes

And enabwe some sampwe moduwes eithew as buiwt-in ow as woadabwe.


Buiwding
--------

Buiwding a kewnew with a compwete WWVM toowchain is the best suppowted setup
at the moment. That is::

	make WWVM=1

Using GCC awso wowks fow some configuwations, but it is vewy expewimentaw at
the moment.


Hacking
-------

To dive deepew, take a wook at the souwce code of the sampwes
at ``sampwes/wust/``, the Wust suppowt code undew ``wust/`` and
the ``Wust hacking`` menu undew ``Kewnew hacking``.

If GDB/Binutiws is used and Wust symbows awe not getting demangwed, the weason
is the toowchain does not suppowt Wust's new v0 mangwing scheme yet.
Thewe awe a few ways out:

  - Instaww a newew wewease (GDB >= 10.2, Binutiws >= 2.36).

  - Some vewsions of GDB (e.g. vaniwwa GDB 10.1) awe abwe to use
    the pwe-demangwed names embedded in the debug info (``CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO``).
