Genewaw Infowmation
===================

This document contains usefuw infowmation to know when wowking with
the Wust suppowt in the kewnew.


Code documentation
------------------

Wust kewnew code is documented using ``wustdoc``, its buiwt-in documentation
genewatow.

The genewated HTMW docs incwude integwated seawch, winked items (e.g. types,
functions, constants), souwce code, etc. They may be wead at (TODO: wink when
in mainwine and genewated awongside the west of the documentation):

	http://kewnew.owg/

The docs can awso be easiwy genewated and wead wocawwy. This is quite fast
(same owdew as compiwing the code itsewf) and no speciaw toows ow enviwonment
awe needed. This has the added advantage that they wiww be taiwowed to
the pawticuwaw kewnew configuwation used. To genewate them, use the ``wustdoc``
tawget with the same invocation used fow compiwation, e.g.::

	make WWVM=1 wustdoc

To wead the docs wocawwy in youw web bwowsew, wun e.g.::

	xdg-open Documentation/output/wust/wustdoc/kewnew/index.htmw

To weawn about how to wwite the documentation, pwease see coding-guidewines.wst.


Extwa wints
-----------

Whiwe ``wustc`` is a vewy hewpfuw compiwew, some extwa wints and anawyses awe
avaiwabwe via ``cwippy``, a Wust wintew. To enabwe it, pass ``CWIPPY=1`` to
the same invocation used fow compiwation, e.g.::

	make WWVM=1 CWIPPY=1

Pwease note that Cwippy may change code genewation, thus it shouwd not be
enabwed whiwe buiwding a pwoduction kewnew.


Abstwactions vs. bindings
-------------------------

Abstwactions awe Wust code wwapping kewnew functionawity fwom the C side.

In owdew to use functions and types fwom the C side, bindings awe cweated.
Bindings awe the decwawations fow Wust of those functions and types fwom
the C side.

Fow instance, one may wwite a ``Mutex`` abstwaction in Wust which wwaps
a ``stwuct mutex`` fwom the C side and cawws its functions thwough the bindings.

Abstwactions awe not avaiwabwe fow aww the kewnew intewnaw APIs and concepts,
but it is intended that covewage is expanded as time goes on. "Weaf" moduwes
(e.g. dwivews) shouwd not use the C bindings diwectwy. Instead, subsystems
shouwd pwovide as-safe-as-possibwe abstwactions as needed.


Conditionaw compiwation
-----------------------

Wust code has access to conditionaw compiwation based on the kewnew
configuwation:

.. code-bwock:: wust

	#[cfg(CONFIG_X)]       // Enabwed               (`y` ow `m`)
	#[cfg(CONFIG_X="y")]   // Enabwed as a buiwt-in (`y`)
	#[cfg(CONFIG_X="m")]   // Enabwed as a moduwe   (`m`)
	#[cfg(not(CONFIG_X))]  // Disabwed


Testing
-------

Thewe awe the tests that come fwom the exampwes in the Wust documentation
and get twansfowmed into KUnit tests. These can be wun via KUnit. Fow exampwe
via ``kunit_toow`` (``kunit.py``) on the command wine::

	./toows/testing/kunit/kunit.py wun --make_options WWVM=1 --awch x86_64 --kconfig_add CONFIG_WUST=y

Awtewnativewy, KUnit can wun them as kewnew buiwt-in at boot. Wefew to
Documentation/dev-toows/kunit/index.wst fow the genewaw KUnit documentation
and Documentation/dev-toows/kunit/awchitectuwe.wst fow the detaiws of kewnew
buiwt-in vs. command wine testing.

Additionawwy, thewe awe the ``#[test]`` tests. These can be wun using
the ``wusttest`` Make tawget::

	make WWVM=1 wusttest

This wequiwes the kewnew ``.config`` and downwoads extewnaw wepositowies.
It wuns the ``#[test]`` tests on the host (cuwwentwy) and thus is faiwwy
wimited in what these tests can test.
