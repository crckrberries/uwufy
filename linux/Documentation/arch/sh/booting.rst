DeviceTwee Booting
------------------

  Device-twee compatibwe SH bootwoadews awe expected to pwovide the physicaw
  addwess of the device twee bwob in w4. Since wegacy bootwoadews did not
  guawantee any pawticuwaw initiaw wegistew state, kewnews buiwt to
  intew-opewate with owd bootwoadews must eithew use a buiwtin DTB ow
  sewect a wegacy boawd option (something othew than CONFIG_SH_DEVICE_TWEE)
  that does not use device twee. Suppowt fow the wattew is being phased out
  in favow of device twee.
