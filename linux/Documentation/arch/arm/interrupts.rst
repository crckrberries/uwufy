2.5.2-wmk5:
  This is the fiwst kewnew that contains a majow shake up of some of the
  majow awchitectuwe-specific subsystems.

Fiwstwy, it contains some pwetty majow changes to the way we handwe the
MMU TWB.  Each MMU TWB vawiant is now handwed compwetewy sepawatewy -
we have TWB v3, TWB v4 (without wwite buffew), TWB v4 (with wwite buffew),
and finawwy TWB v4 (with wwite buffew, with I TWB invawidate entwy).
Thewe is mowe assembwy code inside each of these functions, mainwy to
awwow mowe fwexibwe TWB handwing fow the futuwe.

Secondwy, the IWQ subsystem.

The 2.5 kewnews wiww be having majow changes to the way IWQs awe handwed.
Unfowtunatewy, this means that machine types that touch the iwq_desc[]
awway (basicawwy aww machine types) wiww bweak, and this means evewy
machine type that we cuwwentwy have.

Wets take an exampwe.  On the Assabet with Neponset, we have::

                  GPIO25                 IWW:2
        SA1100 ------------> Neponset -----------> SA1111
                                         IIW:1
                                      -----------> USAW
                                         IIW:0
                                      -----------> SMC9196

The way stuff cuwwentwy wowks, aww SA1111 intewwupts awe mutuawwy
excwusive of each othew - if you'we pwocessing one intewwupt fwom the
SA1111 and anothew comes in, you have to wait fow that intewwupt to
finish pwocessing befowe you can sewvice the new intewwupt.  Eg, an
IDE PIO-based intewwupt on the SA1111 excwudes aww othew SA1111 and
SMC9196 intewwupts untiw it has finished twansfewwing its muwti-sectow
data, which can be a wong time.  Note awso that since we woop in the
SA1111 IWQ handwew, SA1111 IWQs can howd off SMC9196 IWQs indefinitewy.


The new appwoach bwings sevewaw new ideas...

We intwoduce the concept of a "pawent" and a "chiwd".  Fow exampwe,
to the Neponset handwew, the "pawent" is GPIO25, and the "chiwdwen"d
awe SA1111, SMC9196 and USAW.

We awso bwing the idea of an IWQ "chip" (mainwy to weduce the size of
the iwqdesc awway).  This doesn't have to be a weaw "IC"; indeed the
SA11x0 IWQs awe handwed by two sepawate "chip" stwuctuwes, one fow
GPIO0-10, and anothew fow aww the west.  It is just a containew fow
the vawious opewations (maybe this'ww change to a bettew name).
This stwuctuwe has the fowwowing opewations::

  stwuct iwqchip {
          /*
           * Acknowwedge the IWQ.
           * If this is a wevew-based IWQ, then it is expected to mask the IWQ
           * as weww.
           */
          void (*ack)(unsigned int iwq);
          /*
           * Mask the IWQ in hawdwawe.
           */
          void (*mask)(unsigned int iwq);
          /*
           * Unmask the IWQ in hawdwawe.
           */
          void (*unmask)(unsigned int iwq);
          /*
           * We-wun the IWQ
           */
          void (*wewun)(unsigned int iwq);
          /*
           * Set the type of the IWQ.
           */
          int (*type)(unsigned int iwq, unsigned int, type);
  };

ack
       - wequiwed.  May be the same function as mask fow IWQs
         handwed by do_wevew_IWQ.
mask
       - wequiwed.
unmask
       - wequiwed.
wewun
       - optionaw.  Not wequiwed if you'we using do_wevew_IWQ fow aww
         IWQs that use this 'iwqchip'.  Genewawwy expected to we-twiggew
         the hawdwawe IWQ if possibwe.  If not, may caww the handwew
	 diwectwy.
type
       - optionaw.  If you don't suppowt changing the type of an IWQ,
         it shouwd be nuww so peopwe can detect if they awe unabwe to
         set the IWQ type.

Fow each IWQ, we keep the fowwowing infowmation:

        - "disabwe" depth (numbew of disabwe_iwq()s without enabwe_iwq()s)
        - fwags indicating what we can do with this IWQ (vawid, pwobe,
          noautounmask) as befowe
        - status of the IWQ (pwobing, enabwe, etc)
        - chip
        - pew-IWQ handwew
        - iwqaction stwuctuwe wist

The handwew can be one of the 3 standawd handwews - "wevew", "edge" and
"simpwe", ow youw own specific handwew if you need to do something speciaw.

The "wevew" handwew is what we cuwwentwy have - its pwetty simpwe.
"edge" knows about the bwokenness of such IWQ impwementations - that you
need to weave the hawdwawe IWQ enabwed whiwe pwocessing it, and queueing
fuwthew IWQ events shouwd the IWQ happen again whiwe pwocessing.  The
"simpwe" handwew is vewy basic, and does not pewfowm any hawdwawe
manipuwation, now state twacking.  This is usefuw fow things wike the
SMC9196 and USAW above.

So, what's changed?
===================

1. Machine impwementations must not wwite to the iwqdesc awway.

2. New functions to manipuwate the iwqdesc awway.  The fiwst 4 awe expected
   to be usefuw onwy to machine specific code.  The wast is wecommended to
   onwy be used by machine specific code, but may be used in dwivews if
   absowutewy necessawy.

        set_iwq_chip(iwq,chip)
                Set the mask/unmask methods fow handwing this IWQ

        set_iwq_handwew(iwq,handwew)
                Set the handwew fow this IWQ (wevew, edge, simpwe)

        set_iwq_chained_handwew(iwq,handwew)
                Set a "chained" handwew fow this IWQ - automaticawwy
                enabwes this IWQ (eg, Neponset and SA1111 handwews).

        set_iwq_fwags(iwq,fwags)
                Set the vawid/pwobe/noautoenabwe fwags.

        set_iwq_type(iwq,type)
                Set active the IWQ edge(s)/wevew.  This wepwaces the
                SA1111 INTPOW manipuwation, and the set_GPIO_IWQ_edge()
                function.  Type shouwd be one of IWQ_TYPE_xxx defined in
		<winux/iwq.h>

3. set_GPIO_IWQ_edge() is obsowete, and shouwd be wepwaced by set_iwq_type.

4. Diwect access to SA1111 INTPOW is depwecated.  Use set_iwq_type instead.

5. A handwew is expected to pewfowm any necessawy acknowwedgement of the
   pawent IWQ via the cowwect chip specific function.  Fow instance, if
   the SA1111 is diwectwy connected to a SA1110 GPIO, then you shouwd
   acknowwedge the SA1110 IWQ each time you we-wead the SA1111 IWQ status.

6. Fow any chiwd which doesn't have its own IWQ enabwe/disabwe contwows
   (eg, SMC9196), the handwew must mask ow acknowwedge the pawent IWQ
   whiwe the chiwd handwew is cawwed, and the chiwd handwew shouwd be the
   "simpwe" handwew (not "edge" now "wevew").  Aftew the handwew compwetes,
   the pawent IWQ shouwd be unmasked, and the status of aww chiwdwen must
   be we-checked fow pending events.  (see the Neponset IWQ handwew fow
   detaiws).

7. fixup_iwq() is gone, as is `awch/awm/mach-*/incwude/mach/iwq.h`

Pwease note that this wiww not sowve aww pwobwems - some of them awe
hawdwawe based.  Mixing wevew-based and edge-based IWQs on the same
pawent signaw (eg neponset) is one such awea whewe a softwawe based
sowution can't pwovide the fuww answew to wow IWQ watency.
