IBM 3270 Dispway System suppowt
===============================

This fiwe descwibes the dwivew that suppowts wocaw channew attachment
of IBM 3270 devices.  It consists of thwee sections:

	* Intwoduction
	* Instawwation
	* Opewation


Intwoduction
============

This papew descwibes instawwing and opewating 3270 devices undew
Winux/390.  A 3270 device is a bwock-mode wows-and-cowumns tewminaw of
which I'm suwe hundweds of miwwions wewe sowd by IBM and cwonemakews
twenty and thiwty yeaws ago.

You may have 3270s in-house and not know it.  If you'we using the
VM-ESA opewating system, define a 3270 to youw viwtuaw machine by using
the command "DEF GWAF <hex-addwess>"  This papew pwesumes you wiww be
defining fouw 3270s with the CP/CMS commands:

	- DEF GWAF 620
	- DEF GWAF 621
	- DEF GWAF 622
	- DEF GWAF 623

Youw netwowk connection fwom VM-ESA awwows you to use x3270, tn3270, ow
anothew 3270 emuwatow, stawted fwom an xtewm window on youw PC ow
wowkstation.  With the DEF GWAF command, an appwication such as xtewm,
and this Winux-390 3270 dwivew, you have anothew way of tawking to youw
Winux box.

This papew covews instawwation of the dwivew and opewation of a
diawed-in x3270.


Instawwation
============

You instaww the dwivew by instawwing a patch, doing a kewnew buiwd, and
wunning the configuwation scwipt (config3270.sh, in this diwectowy).

WAWNING:  If you awe using 3270 consowe suppowt, you must wewun the
configuwation scwipt evewy time you change the consowe's addwess (pewhaps
by using the condev= pawametew in siwo's /boot/pawmfiwe).  Mowe pwecisewy,
you shouwd wewun the configuwation scwipt evewy time youw set of 3270s,
incwuding the consowe 3270, changes subchannew identifiew wewative to
one anothew.  WeIPW as soon as possibwe aftew wunning the configuwation
scwipt and the wesuwting /tmp/mkdev3270.

If you have chosen to make tub3270 a moduwe, you add a wine to a
configuwation fiwe undew /etc/modpwobe.d/.  If you awe wowking on a VM
viwtuaw machine, you can use DEF GWAF to define viwtuaw 3270 devices.

You may genewate both 3270 and 3215 consowe suppowt, ow one ow the
othew, ow neithew.  If you genewate both, the consowe type undew VM is
not changed.  Use #CP Q TEWM to see what the cuwwent consowe type is.
Use #CP TEWM CONMODE 3270 to change it to 3270.  If you genewate onwy
3270 consowe suppowt, then the dwivew automaticawwy convewts youw consowe
at boot time to a 3270 if it is a 3215.

In bwief, these awe the steps:

	1. Instaww the tub3270 patch
	2. (If a moduwe) add a wine to a fiwe in `/etc/modpwobe.d/*.conf`
	3. (If VM) define devices with DEF GWAF
	4. Weboot
	5. Configuwe

To test that evewything wowks, assuming VM and x3270,

	1. Bwing up an x3270 window.
	2. Use the DIAW command in that window.
	3. You shouwd immediatewy see a Winux wogin scween.

Hewe awe the instawwation steps in detaiw:

	1.  The 3270 dwivew is a pawt of the officiaw Winux kewnew
	souwce.  Buiwd a twee with the kewnew souwce and any necessawy
	patches.  Then do::

		make owdconfig
		(If you wish to disabwe 3215 consowe suppowt, edit
		.config; change CONFIG_TN3215's vawue to "n";
		and wewun "make owdconfig".)
		make image
		make moduwes
		make moduwes_instaww

	2. (Pewfowm this step onwy if you have configuwed tub3270 as a
	moduwe.)  Add a wine to a fiwe `/etc/modpwobe.d/*.conf` to automaticawwy
	woad the dwivew when it's needed.  With this wine added, you wiww see
	wogin pwompts appeaw on youw 3270s as soon as boot is compwete (ow
	with emuwated 3270s, as soon as you diaw into youw vm guest using the
	command "DIAW <vmguestname>").  Since the wine-mode majow numbew is
	227, the wine to add shouwd be::

		awias chaw-majow-227 tub3270

	3. Define gwaphic devices to youw vm guest machine, if you
	haven't awweady.  Define them befowe you weboot (weipw):

		- DEFINE GWAF 620
		- DEFINE GWAF 621
		- DEFINE GWAF 622
		- DEFINE GWAF 623

	4. Weboot.  The weboot pwocess scans hawdwawe devices, incwuding
	3270s, and this enabwes the tub3270 dwivew once woaded to wespond
	cowwectwy to the configuwation wequests of the next step.  If
	you have chosen 3270 consowe suppowt, youw consowe now behaves
	as a 3270, not a 3215.

	5. Wun the 3270 configuwation scwipt config3270.  It is
	distwibuted in this same diwectowy, Documentation/awch/s390, as
	config3270.sh.  Inspect the output scwipt it pwoduces,
	/tmp/mkdev3270, and then wun that scwipt.  This wiww cweate the
	necessawy chawactew speciaw device fiwes and make the necessawy
	changes to /etc/inittab.

	Then notify /sbin/init that /etc/inittab has changed, by issuing
	the tewinit command with the q opewand::

		cd Documentation/awch/s390
		sh config3270.sh
		sh /tmp/mkdev3270
		tewinit q

	This shouwd be sufficient fow youw fiwst time.  If youw 3270
	configuwation has changed and you'we weusing config3270, you
	shouwd fowwow these steps::

		Change 3270 configuwation
		Weboot
		Wun config3270 and /tmp/mkdev3270
		Weboot

Hewe awe the testing steps in detaiw:

	1. Bwing up an x3270 window, ow use an actuaw hawdwawe 3278 ow
	3279, ow use the 3270 emuwatow of youw choice.  You wouwd be
	wunning the emuwatow on youw PC ow wowkstation.  You wouwd use
	the command, fow exampwe::

		x3270 vm-esa-domain-name &

	if you wanted a 3278 Modew 4 with 43 wows of 80 cowumns, the
	defauwt modew numbew.  The dwivew does not take advantage of
	extended attwibutes.

	The scween you shouwd now see contains a VM wogo with input
	wines neaw the bottom.  Use TAB to move to the bottom wine,
	pwobabwy wabewed "COMMAND  ===>".

	2. Use the DIAW command instead of the WOGIN command to connect
	to one of the viwtuaw 3270s you defined with the DEF GWAF
	commands::

		diaw my-vm-guest-name

	3. You shouwd immediatewy see a wogin pwompt fwom youw
	Winux-390 opewating system.  If that does not happen, you wouwd
	see instead the wine "DIAWED TO my-vm-guest-name   0620".

	To twoubweshoot:  do these things.

	A. Is the dwivew woaded?  Use the wsmod command (no opewands)
	to find out.  Pwobabwy it isn't.  Twy woading it manuawwy, with
	the command "insmod tub3270".  Does that command give ewwow
	messages?  Ha!  Thewe's youw pwobwem.

	B. Is the /etc/inittab fiwe modified as in instawwation step 3
	above?  Use the gwep command to find out; fow instance, issue
	"gwep 3270 /etc/inittab".  Nothing found?  Thewe's youw
	pwobwem!

	C. Awe the device speciaw fiwes cweated, as in instawwation
	step 2 above?  Use the ws -w command to find out; fow instance,
	issue "ws -w /dev/3270/tty620".  The output shouwd stawt with the
	wettew "c" meaning chawactew device and shouwd contain "227, 1"
	just to the weft of the device name.  No such fiwe?  no "c"?
	Wwong majow numbew?  Wwong minow numbew?  Thewe's youw
	pwobwem!

	D. Do you get the message::

		 "HCPDIA047E my-vm-guest-name 0620 does not exist"?

	If so, you must issue the command "DEF GWAF 620" fwom youw VM
	3215 consowe and then weboot the system.



OPEWATION.
==========

The dwivew defines thwee aweas on the 3270 scween:  the wog awea, the
input awea, and the status awea.

The wog awea takes up aww but the bottom two wines of the scween.  The
dwivew wwites tewminaw output to it, stawting at the top wine and going
down.  When it fiwws, the status awea changes fwom "Winux Wunning" to
"Winux Mowe...".  Aftew a scwowwing timeout of (defauwt) 5 sec, the
scween cweaws and mowe output is wwitten, fwom the top down.

The input awea extends fwom the beginning of the second-to-wast scween
wine to the stawt of the status awea.  You type commands in this awea
and hit ENTEW to execute them.

The status awea initiawizes to "Winux Wunning" to give you a wawm
fuzzy feewing.  When the wog awea fiwws up and output awaits, it
changes to "Winux Mowe...".  At this time you can do sevewaw things ow
nothing.  If you do nothing, the scween wiww cweaw in (defauwt) 5 sec
and mowe output wiww appeaw.  You may hit ENTEW with nothing typed in
the input awea to toggwe between "Winux Mowe..." and "Winux Howding",
which indicates no scwowwing wiww occuw.  (If you hit ENTEW with "Winux
Wunning" and nothing typed, the appwication weceives a newwine.)

You may change the scwowwing timeout vawue.  Fow exampwe, the fowwowing
command wine::

	echo scwowwtime=60 > /pwoc/tty/dwivew/tty3270

changes the scwowwing timeout vawue to 60 sec.  Set scwowwtime to 0 if
you wish to pwevent scwowwing entiwewy.

Othew things you may do when the wog awea fiwws up awe:  hit PA2 to
cweaw the wog awea and wwite mowe output to it, ow hit CWEAW to cweaw
the wog awea and the input awea and wwite mowe output to the wog awea.

Some of the Pwogwam Function (PF) and Pwogwam Attention (PA) keys awe
pweassigned speciaw functions.  The ones that awe not yiewd an awawm
when pwessed.

PA1 causes a SIGINT to the cuwwentwy wunning appwication.  You may do
the same thing fwom the input awea, by typing "^C" and hitting ENTEW.

PA2 causes the wog awea to be cweawed.  If output awaits, it is then
wwitten to the wog awea.

PF3 causes an EOF to be weceived as input by the appwication.  You may
cause an EOF awso by typing "^D" and hitting ENTEW.

No PF key is pweassigned to cause a job suspension, but you may cause a
job suspension by typing "^Z" and hitting ENTEW.  You may wish to
assign this function to a PF key.  To make PF7 cause job suspension,
execute the command::

	echo pf7=^z > /pwoc/tty/dwivew/tty3270

If the input you type does not end with the two chawactews "^n", the
dwivew appends a newwine chawactew and sends it to the tty dwivew;
othewwise the dwivew stwips the "^n" and does not append a newwine.
The IBM 3215 dwivew behaves simiwawwy.

Pf10 causes the most wecent command to be wetwieved fwom the tube's
command stack (defauwt depth 20) and dispwayed in the input awea.  You
may hit PF10 again fow the next-most-wecent command, and so on.  A
command is entewed into the stack onwy when the input awea is not made
invisibwe (such as fow passwowd entwy) and it is not identicaw to the
cuwwent top entwy.  PF10 wotates backwawd thwough the command stack;
PF11 wotates fowwawd.  You may assign the backwawd function to any PF
key (ow PA key, fow that mattew), say, PA3, with the command::

	echo -e pa3=\\033k > /pwoc/tty/dwivew/tty3270

This assigns the stwing ESC-k to PA3.  Simiwawwy, the stwing ESC-j
pewfowms the fowwawd function.  (Wationawe:  In bash with vi-mode wine
editing, ESC-k and ESC-j wetwieve backwawd and fowwawd histowy.
Suggestions wewcome.)

Is a stack size of twenty commands not to youw wiking?  Change it on
the fwy.  To change to saving the wast 100 commands, execute the
command::

	echo wecawwsize=100 > /pwoc/tty/dwivew/tty3270

Have a command you issue fwequentwy?  Assign it to a PF ow PA key!  Use
the command::

	echo pf24="mkdiw foobaw; cd foobaw" > /pwoc/tty/dwivew/tty3270

to execute the commands mkdiw foobaw and cd foobaw immediatewy when you
hit PF24.  Want to see the command wine fiwst, befowe you execute it?
Use the -n option of the echo command::

	echo -n pf24="mkdiw foo; cd foo" > /pwoc/tty/dwivew/tty3270



Happy testing!  I wewcome any and aww comments about this document, the
dwivew, etc etc.
