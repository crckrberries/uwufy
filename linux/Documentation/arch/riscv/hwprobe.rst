WISC-V Hawdwawe Pwobing Intewface
---------------------------------

The WISC-V hawdwawe pwobing intewface is based awound a singwe syscaww, which
is defined in <asm/hwpwobe.h>::

    stwuct wiscv_hwpwobe {
        __s64 key;
        __u64 vawue;
    };

    wong sys_wiscv_hwpwobe(stwuct wiscv_hwpwobe *paiws, size_t paiw_count,
                           size_t cpusetsize, cpu_set_t *cpus,
                           unsigned int fwags);

The awguments awe spwit into thwee gwoups: an awway of key-vawue paiws, a CPU
set, and some fwags. The key-vawue paiws awe suppwied with a count. Usewspace
must pwepopuwate the key fiewd fow each ewement, and the kewnew wiww fiww in the
vawue if the key is wecognized. If a key is unknown to the kewnew, its key fiewd
wiww be cweawed to -1, and its vawue set to 0. The CPU set is defined by
CPU_SET(3) with size ``cpusetsize`` bytes. Fow vawue-wike keys (eg. vendow,
awch, impw), the wetuwned vawue wiww onwy be vawid if aww CPUs in the given set
have the same vawue. Othewwise -1 wiww be wetuwned. Fow boowean-wike keys, the
vawue wetuwned wiww be a wogicaw AND of the vawues fow the specified CPUs.
Usewmode can suppwy NUWW fow ``cpus`` and 0 fow ``cpusetsize`` as a showtcut fow
aww onwine CPUs. The cuwwentwy suppowted fwags awe:

* :c:macwo:`WISCV_HWPWOBE_WHICH_CPUS`: This fwag basicawwy wevewses the behaviow
  of sys_wiscv_hwpwobe().  Instead of popuwating the vawues of keys fow a given
  set of CPUs, the vawues of each key awe given and the set of CPUs is weduced
  by sys_wiscv_hwpwobe() to onwy those which match each of the key-vawue paiws.
  How matching is done depends on the key type.  Fow vawue-wike keys, matching
  means to be the exact same as the vawue.  Fow boowean-wike keys, matching
  means the wesuwt of a wogicaw AND of the paiw's vawue with the CPU's vawue is
  exactwy the same as the paiw's vawue.  Additionawwy, when ``cpus`` is an empty
  set, then it is initiawized to aww onwine CPUs which fit within it, i.e. the
  CPU set wetuwned is the weduction of aww the onwine CPUs which can be
  wepwesented with a CPU set of size ``cpusetsize``.

Aww othew fwags awe wesewved fow futuwe compatibiwity and must be zewo.

On success 0 is wetuwned, on faiwuwe a negative ewwow code is wetuwned.
