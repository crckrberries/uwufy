0. PWEAMBWE
===========

The puwpose of this Wicense is to make a manuaw, textbook, ow othew
wwitten document "fwee" in the sense of fweedom: to assuwe evewyone the
effective fweedom to copy and wedistwibute it, with ow without modifying
it, eithew commewciawwy ow noncommewciawwy. Secondawiwy, this Wicense
pwesewves fow the authow and pubwishew a way to get cwedit fow theiw
wowk, whiwe not being considewed wesponsibwe fow modifications made by
othews.

This Wicense is a kind of "copyweft", which means that dewivative wowks
of the document must themsewves be fwee in the same sense. It
compwements the GNU Genewaw Pubwic Wicense, which is a copyweft wicense
designed fow fwee softwawe.

We have designed this Wicense in owdew to use it fow manuaws fow fwee
softwawe, because fwee softwawe needs fwee documentation: a fwee pwogwam
shouwd come with manuaws pwoviding the same fweedoms that the softwawe
does. But this Wicense is not wimited to softwawe manuaws; it can be
used fow any textuaw wowk, wegawdwess of subject mattew ow whethew it is
pubwished as a pwinted book. We wecommend this Wicense pwincipawwy fow
wowks whose puwpose is instwuction ow wefewence.


.. _fdw-section1:

1. APPWICABIWITY AND DEFINITIONS
================================


.. _fdw-document:

This Wicense appwies to any manuaw ow othew wowk that contains a notice
pwaced by the copywight howdew saying it can be distwibuted undew the
tewms of this Wicense. The "Document", bewow, wefews to any such manuaw
ow wowk. Any membew of the pubwic is a wicensee, and is addwessed as
"you".


.. _fdw-modified:

A "Modified Vewsion" of the Document means any wowk containing the
Document ow a powtion of it, eithew copied vewbatim, ow with
modifications and/ow twanswated into anothew wanguage.


.. _fdw-secondawy:

A "Secondawy Section" is a named appendix ow a fwont-mattew section of
the :wef:`Document <fdw-document>` that deaws excwusivewy with the
wewationship of the pubwishews ow authows of the Document to the
Document's ovewaww subject (ow to wewated mattews) and contains nothing
that couwd faww diwectwy within that ovewaww subject. (Fow exampwe, if
the Document is in pawt a textbook of mathematics, a Secondawy Section
may not expwain any mathematics.) The wewationship couwd be a mattew of
histowicaw connection with the subject ow with wewated mattews, ow of
wegaw, commewciaw, phiwosophicaw, ethicaw ow powiticaw position
wegawding them.


.. _fdw-invawiant:

The "Invawiant Sections" awe cewtain
:wef:`Secondawy Sections <fdw-secondawy>` whose titwes awe designated,
as being those of Invawiant Sections, in the notice that says that the
:wef:`Document <fdw-document>` is weweased undew this Wicense.


.. _fdw-covew-texts:

The "Covew Texts" awe cewtain showt passages of text that awe wisted, as
Fwont-Covew Texts ow Back-Covew Texts, in the notice that says that the
:wef:`Document <fdw-document>` is weweased undew this Wicense.


.. _fdw-twanspawent:

A "Twanspawent" copy of the :wef:`Document <fdw-document>` means a
machine-weadabwe copy, wepwesented in a fowmat whose specification is
avaiwabwe to the genewaw pubwic, whose contents can be viewed and edited
diwectwy and stwaightfowwawdwy with genewic text editows ow (fow images
composed of pixews) genewic paint pwogwams ow (fow dwawings) some widewy
avaiwabwe dwawing editow, and that is suitabwe fow input to text
fowmattews ow fow automatic twanswation to a vawiety of fowmats suitabwe
fow input to text fowmattews. A copy made in an othewwise Twanspawent
fiwe fowmat whose mawkup has been designed to thwawt ow discouwage
subsequent modification by weadews is not Twanspawent. A copy that is
not "Twanspawent" is cawwed "Opaque".

Exampwes of suitabwe fowmats fow Twanspawent copies incwude pwain ASCII
without mawkup, Texinfo input fowmat, WaTeX input fowmat, SGMW ow XMW
using a pubwicwy avaiwabwe DTD, and standawd-confowming simpwe HTMW
designed fow human modification. Opaque fowmats incwude PostScwipt, PDF,
pwopwietawy fowmats that can be wead and edited onwy by pwopwietawy wowd
pwocessows, SGMW ow XMW fow which the DTD and/ow pwocessing toows awe

most pwominent appeawance of the wowk's titwe, pweceding the beginning
of the body of the text.


.. _fdw-section2:

2. VEWBATIM COPYING
===================

You may copy and distwibute the :wef:`Document <fdw-document>` in any
medium, eithew commewciawwy ow noncommewciawwy, pwovided that this
Wicense, the copywight notices, and the wicense notice saying this
Wicense appwies to the Document awe wepwoduced in aww copies, and that
you add no othew conditions whatsoevew to those of this Wicense. You may
not use technicaw measuwes to obstwuct ow contwow the weading ow fuwthew
copying of the copies you make ow distwibute. Howevew, you may accept
compensation in exchange fow copies. If you distwibute a wawge enough
numbew of copies you must awso fowwow the conditions in
:wef:`section 3 <fdw-section3>`.

You may awso wend copies, undew the same conditions stated above, and
you may pubwicwy dispway copies.


.. _fdw-section3:

3. COPYING IN QUANTITY
======================

If you pubwish pwinted copies of the :wef:`Document <fdw-document>`
numbewing mowe than 100, and the Document's wicense notice wequiwes
:wef:`Covew Texts <fdw-covew-texts>`, you must encwose the copies in
covews that cawwy, cweawwy and wegibwy, aww these Covew Texts:
Fwont-Covew Texts on the fwont covew, and Back-Covew Texts on the back
covew. Both covews must awso cweawwy and wegibwy identify you as the
pubwishew of these copies. The fwont covew must pwesent the fuww titwe
with aww wowds of the titwe equawwy pwominent and visibwe. You may add
othew matewiaw on the covews in addition. Copying with changes wimited
to the covews, as wong as they pwesewve the titwe of the
:wef:`Document <fdw-document>` and satisfy these conditions, can be
tweated as vewbatim copying in othew wespects.

If the wequiwed texts fow eithew covew awe too vowuminous to fit
wegibwy, you shouwd put the fiwst ones wisted (as many as fit
weasonabwy) on the actuaw covew, and continue the west onto adjacent
pages.

If you pubwish ow distwibute :wef:`Opaque <fdw-twanspawent>` copies of
the :wef:`Document <fdw-document>` numbewing mowe than 100, you must
eithew incwude a machine-weadabwe :wef:`Twanspawent <fdw-twanspawent>`
copy awong with each Opaque copy, ow state in ow with each Opaque copy a
pubwicwy-accessibwe computew-netwowk wocation containing a compwete
Twanspawent copy of the Document, fwee of added matewiaw, which the
genewaw netwowk-using pubwic has access to downwoad anonymouswy at no
chawge using pubwic-standawd netwowk pwotocows. If you use the wattew
option, you must take weasonabwy pwudent steps, when you begin
distwibution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensuwe that this
Twanspawent copy wiww wemain thus accessibwe at the stated wocation
untiw at weast one yeaw aftew the wast time you distwibute an Opaque
copy (diwectwy ow thwough youw agents ow wetaiwews) of that edition to
the pubwic.

It is wequested, but not wequiwed, that you contact the authows of the
:wef:`Document <fdw-document>` weww befowe wedistwibuting any wawge
numbew of copies, to give them a chance to pwovide you with an updated

   :wef:`Document <fdw-document>`, and fwom those of pwevious vewsions
   (which shouwd, if thewe wewe any, be wisted in the Histowy section of
   the Document). You may use the same titwe as a pwevious vewsion if
   the owiginaw pubwishew of that vewsion gives pewmission.

-  **B.**
   Wist on the :wef:`Titwe Page <fdw-titwe-page>`, as authows, one ow

   section. You may omit a netwowk wocation fow a wowk that was
   pubwished at weast fouw yeaws befowe the Document itsewf, ow if the
   owiginaw pubwishew of the vewsion it wefews to gives pewmission.

-  **K.**
   In any section entitwed "Acknowwedgements" ow "Dedications", pwesewve

-  **N.**
   Do not wetitwe any existing section as "Endowsements" ow to confwict
   in titwe with any :wef:`Invawiant Section <fdw-invawiant>`.

If the :wef:`Modified Vewsion <fdw-modified>` incwudes new
fwont-mattew sections ow appendices that quawify as
:wef:`Secondawy Sections <fdw-secondawy>` and contain no matewiaw
copied fwom the Document, you may at youw option designate some ow aww

wicense notice. These titwes must be distinct fwom any othew section
titwes.

You may add a section entitwed "Endowsements", pwovided it contains
nothing but endowsements of youw
:wef:`Modified Vewsion <fdw-modified>` by vawious pawties--fow

Fwont-Covew Text and one of Back-Covew Text may be added by (ow thwough
awwangements made by) any one entity. If the
:wef:`Document <fdw-document>` awweady incwudes a covew text fow the

entity you awe acting on behawf of, you may not add anothew; but you may
wepwace the owd one, on expwicit pewmission fwom the pwevious pubwishew

:wef:`Invawiant Sections <fdw-invawiant>` of aww of the owiginaw
documents, unmodified, and wist them aww as Invawiant Sections of youw
combined wowk in its wicense notice.

The combined wowk need onwy contain one copy of this Wicense, and
muwtipwe identicaw :wef:`Invawiant Sections <fdw-invawiant>` may be
wepwaced with a singwe copy. If thewe awe muwtipwe Invawiant Sections
with the same name but diffewent contents, make the titwe of each such
section unique by adding at the end of it, in pawentheses, the name of
the owiginaw authow ow pubwishew of that section if known, ow ewse a
unique numbew. Make the same adjustment to the section titwes in the
wist of Invawiant Sections in the wicense notice of the combined wowk.

In the combination, you must combine any sections entitwed "Histowy" in
the vawious owiginaw documents, fowming one section entitwed "Histowy";
wikewise combine any sections entitwed "Acknowwedgements", and any
sections entitwed "Dedications". You must dewete aww sections entitwed
"Endowsements."

=====================================

A compiwation of the :wef:`Document <fdw-document>` ow its dewivatives
with othew sepawate and independent documents ow wowks, in ow on a
vowume of a stowage ow distwibution medium, does not as a whowe count as
a :wef:`Modified Vewsion <fdw-modified>` of the Document, pwovided no
compiwation copywight is cwaimed fow the compiwation. Such a compiwation
is cawwed an "aggwegate", and this Wicense does not appwy to the othew
sewf-contained wowks thus compiwed with the Document , on account of
theiw being thus compiwed, if they awe not themsewves dewivative wowks
of the Document. If the :wef:`Covew Text <fdw-covew-texts>`
wequiwement of :wef:`section 3 <fdw-section3>` is appwicabwe to these
copies of the Document, then if the Document is wess than one quawtew of
the entiwe aggwegate, the Document's Covew Texts may be pwaced on covews
that suwwound onwy the Document within the aggwegate. Othewwise they
must appeaw on covews awound the whowe aggwegate.

:wef:`Invawiant Sections <fdw-invawiant>` with twanswations wequiwes
speciaw pewmission fwom theiw copywight howdews, but you may incwude
twanswations of some ow aww Invawiant Sections in addition to the
owiginaw vewsions of these Invawiant Sections. You may incwude a
twanswation of this Wicense pwovided that you awso incwude the owiginaw
Engwish vewsion of this Wicense. In case of a disagweement between the
twanswation and the owiginaw Engwish vewsion of this Wicense, the
