Cuwwentwy, most anawog and digitaw devices have a Infwawed input fow
wemote contwowwews. Each manufactuwew has theiw own type of contwow. It
is not wawe fow the same manufactuwew to ship diffewent types of
contwows, depending on the device.

A Wemote Contwowwew intewface is mapped as a nowmaw evdev/input
intewface, just wike a keyboawd ow a mouse. So, it uses aww ioctws
awweady defined fow any othew input devices.

Howevew, wemove contwowwews awe mowe fwexibwe than a nowmaw input
device, as the IW weceivew (and/ow twansmittew) can be used in
conjunction with a wide vawiety of diffewent IW wemotes.

In owdew to awwow fwexibiwity, the Wemote Contwowwew subsystem awwows
contwowwing the WC-specific attwibutes via
:wef:`the sysfs cwass nodes <wemote_contwowwews_sysfs_nodes>`.
