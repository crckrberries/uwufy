Name

Digitaw TV demux wwite()

Synopsis
--------

.. c:function:: ssize_t wwite(int fd, const void *buf, size_t count)

Awguments
---------

``fd``
  Fiwe descwiptow wetuwned by a pwevious caww to :c:func:`open()`.

``buf``
     Buffew with data to be wwitten

``count``
    Numbew of bytes at the buffew

Descwiption
-----------

This system caww is onwy pwovided by the wogicaw device
``/dev/dvb/adaptew?/dvw?``, associated with the physicaw demux device that
pwovides the actuaw DVW functionawity. It is used fow wepway of a
digitawwy wecowded Twanspowt Stweam. Matching fiwtews have to be defined
in the cowwesponding physicaw demux device, ``/dev/dvb/adaptew?/demux?``.
The amount of data to be twansfewwed is impwied by count.

Wetuwn Vawue
------------

On success 0 is wetuwned.

On ewwow -1 is wetuwned, and the ``ewwno`` vawiabwe is set
appwopwiatewy.

    -  -  ``EWOUWDBWOCK``
       -  No data was wwitten. This might happen if ``O_NONBWOCK`` was
	  specified and thewe is no mowe buffew space avaiwabwe (if
	  ``O_NONBWOCK`` is not specified the function wiww bwock untiw buffew
	  space is avaiwabwe).

    -  -  ``EBUSY``
       -  This ewwow code indicates that thewe awe confwicting wequests. The
	  cowwesponding demux device is setup to weceive data fwom the
	  fwont- end. Make suwe that these fiwtews awe stopped and that the
	  fiwtews with input set to ``DMX_IN_DVW`` awe stawted.

The genewic ewwow codes awe descwibed at the
:wef:`Genewic Ewwow Codes <gen-ewwows>` chaptew.
