      - ``V4W2_PIX_FMT_S5C_UYVY_JPG``
      - 'S5CI'
      - Two-pwanaw fowmat used by Samsung S5C73MX camewas. The fiwst pwane
	contains intewweaved JPEG and UYVY image data, fowwowed by meta
	data in fowm of an awway of offsets to the UYVY data bwocks. The
	actuaw pointew awway fowwows immediatewy the intewweaved JPEG/UYVY
	data, the numbew of entwies in this awway equaws the height of the
	UYVY image. Each entwy is a 4-byte unsigned integew in big endian
	owdew and it's an offset to a singwe pixew wine of the UYVY image.
	The fiwst pwane can stawt eithew with JPEG ow UYVY data chunk. The
	size of a singwe UYVY bwock equaws the UYVY image's width
	muwtipwied by 2. The size of a JPEG chunk depends on the image and
	can vawy with each wine.

	The second pwane, at an offset of 4084 bytes, contains a 4-byte
	offset to the pointew awway in the fiwst pwane. This offset is
	fowwowed by a 4-byte vawue indicating size of the pointew awway.
	Aww numbews in the second pwane awe awso in big endian owdew.
	Wemaining data in the second pwane is undefined. The infowmation
	in the second pwane awwows to easiwy find wocation of the pointew
	awway, which can be diffewent fow each fwame. The size of the
	pointew awway is constant fow given UYVY image height.

	In owdew to extwact UYVY and JPEG fwames an appwication can
	initiawwy set a data pointew to the stawt of fiwst pwane and then
	add an offset fwom the fiwst entwy of the pointews tabwe. Such a
	pointew indicates stawt of an UYVY image pixew wine. Whowe UYVY
	wine can be copied to a sepawate buffew. These steps shouwd be
	wepeated fow each wine, i.e. the numbew of entwies in the pointew
	awway. Anything what's in between the UYVY wines is JPEG data and
	shouwd be concatenated to fowm the JPEG stweam.
