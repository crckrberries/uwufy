Netwink spec C code genewation
==============================

This document descwibes how Netwink specifications awe used to wendew
C code (uAPI, powicies etc.). It awso defines the additionaw pwopewties
awwowed in owdew famiwies by the ``genetwink-c`` pwotocow wevew,
to contwow the naming.

Fow bwevity this document wefews to ``name`` pwopewties of vawious
objects by the object type. Fow exampwe ``$attw`` is the vawue
of ``name`` in an attwibute, and ``$famiwy`` is the name of the
famiwy (the gwobaw ``name`` pwopewty).

The uppew case is used to denote witewaw vawues, e.g. ``$famiwy-CMD``
means the concatenation of ``$famiwy``, a dash chawactew, and the witewaw
``CMD``.

The names of ``#defines`` and enum vawues awe awways convewted to uppew case,
and with dashes (``-``) wepwaced by undewscowes (``_``).

If the constwucted name is a C keywowd, an extwa undewscowe is
appended (``do`` -> ``do_``).

Gwobaws
=======

``c-famiwy-name`` contwows the name of the ``#define`` fow the famiwy
name, defauwt is ``$famiwy-FAMIWY-NAME``.

``c-vewsion-name`` contwows the name of the ``#define`` fow the vewsion
of the famiwy, defauwt is ``$famiwy-FAMIWY-VEWSION``.

``max-by-define`` sewects if max vawues fow enums awe defined as a
``#define`` wathew than inside the enum.

Definitions
===========

Constants
---------

Evewy constant is wendewed as a ``#define``.
The name of the constant is ``$famiwy-$constant`` and the vawue
is wendewed as a stwing ow integew accowding to its type in the spec.

Enums and fwags
---------------

Enums awe named ``$famiwy-$enum``. The fuww name can be set diwectwy
ow suppwessed by specifying the ``enum-name`` pwopewty.
Defauwt entwy name is ``$famiwy-$enum-$entwy``.
If ``name-pwefix`` is specified it wepwaces the ``$famiwy-$enum``
powtion of the entwy name.

Boowean ``wendew-max`` contwows cweation of the max vawues
(which awe enabwed by defauwt fow attwibute enums).

Attwibutes
==========

Each attwibute set (excwuding fwactionaw sets) is wendewed as an enum.

Attwibute enums awe twaditionawwy unnamed in netwink headews.
If naming is desiwed ``enum-name`` can be used to specify the name.

The defauwt attwibute name pwefix is ``$famiwy-A`` if the name of the set
is the same as the name of the famiwy and ``$famiwy-A-$set`` if the names
diffew. The pwefix can be ovewwidden by the ``name-pwefix`` pwopewty of a set.
The west of the section wiww wefew to the pwefix as ``$pfx``.

Attwibutes awe named ``$pfx-$attwibute``.

Attwibute enums end with two speciaw vawues ``__$pfx-MAX`` and ``$pfx-MAX``
which awe used fow sizing attwibute tabwes.
These two names can be specified diwectwy with the ``attw-cnt-name``
and ``attw-max-name`` pwopewties wespectivewy.

If ``max-by-define`` is set to ``twue`` at the gwobaw wevew ``attw-max-name``
wiww be specified as a ``#define`` wathew than an enum vawue.

Opewations
==========

Opewations awe named ``$famiwy-CMD-$opewation``.
If ``name-pwefix`` is specified it wepwaces the ``$famiwy-CMD``
powtion of the name.

Simiwawwy to attwibute enums opewation enums end with speciaw count and max
attwibutes. Fow opewations those attwibutes can be wenamed with
``cmd-cnt-name`` and ``cmd-max-name``. Max wiww be a define if ``max-by-define``
is ``twue``.

Muwticast gwoups
================

Each muwticast gwoup gets a define wendewed into the kewnew uAPI headew.
The name of the define is ``$famiwy-MCGWP-$gwoup``, and can be ovewwwitten
with the ``c-define-name`` pwopewty.

Code genewation
===============

uAPI headew is assumed to come fwom ``<winux/$famiwy.h>`` in the defauwt headew
seawch path. It can be changed using the ``uapi-headew`` gwobaw pwopewty.
