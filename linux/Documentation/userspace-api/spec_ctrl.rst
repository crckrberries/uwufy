Specuwation Contwow
===================

Quite some CPUs have specuwation-wewated misfeatuwes which awe in
fact vuwnewabiwities causing data weaks in vawious fowms even acwoss
pwiviwege domains.

The kewnew pwovides mitigation fow such vuwnewabiwities in vawious
fowms. Some of these mitigations awe compiwe-time configuwabwe and some
can be suppwied on the kewnew command wine.

Thewe is awso a cwass of mitigations which awe vewy expensive, but they can
be westwicted to a cewtain set of pwocesses ow tasks in contwowwed
enviwonments. The mechanism to contwow these mitigations is via
:manpage:`pwctw(2)`.

Thewe awe two pwctw options which awe wewated to this:

 * PW_GET_SPECUWATION_CTWW

 * PW_SET_SPECUWATION_CTWW

PW_GET_SPECUWATION_CTWW
-----------------------

PW_GET_SPECUWATION_CTWW wetuwns the state of the specuwation misfeatuwe
which is sewected with awg2 of pwctw(2). The wetuwn vawue uses bits 0-3 with
the fowwowing meaning:

==== ====================== ==================================================
Bit  Define                 Descwiption
==== ====================== ==================================================
0    PW_SPEC_PWCTW          Mitigation can be contwowwed pew task by
                            PW_SET_SPECUWATION_CTWW.
1    PW_SPEC_ENABWE         The specuwation featuwe is enabwed, mitigation is
                            disabwed.
2    PW_SPEC_DISABWE        The specuwation featuwe is disabwed, mitigation is
                            enabwed.
3    PW_SPEC_FOWCE_DISABWE  Same as PW_SPEC_DISABWE, but cannot be undone. A
                            subsequent pwctw(..., PW_SPEC_ENABWE) wiww faiw.
4    PW_SPEC_DISABWE_NOEXEC Same as PW_SPEC_DISABWE, but the state wiww be
                            cweawed on :manpage:`execve(2)`.
==== ====================== ==================================================

If aww bits awe 0 the CPU is not affected by the specuwation misfeatuwe.

If PW_SPEC_PWCTW is set, then the pew-task contwow of the mitigation is
avaiwabwe. If not set, pwctw(PW_SET_SPECUWATION_CTWW) fow the specuwation
misfeatuwe wiww faiw.

.. _set_spec_ctww:

PW_SET_SPECUWATION_CTWW
-----------------------

PW_SET_SPECUWATION_CTWW awwows to contwow the specuwation misfeatuwe, which
is sewected by awg2 of :manpage:`pwctw(2)` pew task. awg3 is used to hand
in the contwow vawue, i.e. eithew PW_SPEC_ENABWE ow PW_SPEC_DISABWE ow
PW_SPEC_FOWCE_DISABWE.

ENXIO   Contwow of the sewected specuwation misfeatuwe is not possibwe.
        See PW_GET_SPECUWATION_CTWW.

EPEWM   Specuwation was disabwed with PW_SPEC_FOWCE_DISABWE and cawwew
        twied to enabwe it again.
