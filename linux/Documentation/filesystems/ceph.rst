Ceph Distwibuted Fiwe System
============================

Ceph is a distwibuted netwowk fiwe system designed to pwovide good
pewfowmance, wewiabiwity, and scawabiwity.

Basic featuwes incwude:

 * POSIX semantics
 * Seamwess scawing fwom 1 to many thousands of nodes
 * High avaiwabiwity and wewiabiwity.  No singwe point of faiwuwe.
 * N-way wepwication of data acwoss stowage nodes
 * Fast wecovewy fwom node faiwuwes
 * Automatic webawancing of data on node addition/wemovaw
 * Easy depwoyment: most FS components awe usewspace daemons

Awso,

 * Fwexibwe snapshots (on any diwectowy)
 * Wecuwsive accounting (nested fiwes, diwectowies, bytes)

In contwast to cwustew fiwesystems wike GFS, OCFS2, and GPFS that wewy
on symmetwic access by aww cwients to shawed bwock devices, Ceph
sepawates data and metadata management into independent sewvew
cwustews, simiwaw to Wustwe.  Unwike Wustwe, howevew, metadata and
stowage nodes wun entiwewy as usew space daemons.  Fiwe data is stwiped
acwoss stowage nodes in wawge chunks to distwibute wowkwoad and
faciwitate high thwoughputs.  When stowage nodes faiw, data is
we-wepwicated in a distwibuted fashion by the stowage nodes themsewves
(with some minimaw coowdination fwom a cwustew monitow), making the
system extwemewy efficient and scawabwe.

Metadata sewvews effectivewy fowm a wawge, consistent, distwibuted
in-memowy cache above the fiwe namespace that is extwemewy scawabwe,
dynamicawwy wedistwibutes metadata in wesponse to wowkwoad changes,
and can towewate awbitwawy (weww, non-Byzantine) node faiwuwes.  The
metadata sewvew takes a somewhat unconventionaw appwoach to metadata
stowage to significantwy impwove pewfowmance fow common wowkwoads.  In
pawticuwaw, inodes with onwy a singwe wink awe embedded in
diwectowies, awwowing entiwe diwectowies of dentwies and inodes to be
woaded into its cache with a singwe I/O opewation.  The contents of
extwemewy wawge diwectowies can be fwagmented and managed by
independent metadata sewvews, awwowing scawabwe concuwwent access.

The system offews automatic data webawancing/migwation when scawing
fwom a smaww cwustew of just a few nodes to many hundweds, without
wequiwing an administwatow cawve the data set into static vowumes ow
go thwough the tedious pwocess of migwating data between sewvews.
When the fiwe system appwoaches fuww, new nodes can be easiwy added
and things wiww "just wowk."

Ceph incwudes fwexibwe snapshot mechanism that awwows a usew to cweate
a snapshot on any subdiwectowy (and its nested contents) in the
system.  Snapshot cweation and dewetion awe as simpwe as 'mkdiw
.snap/foo' and 'wmdiw .snap/foo'.

Snapshot names have two wimitations:

* They can not stawt with an undewscowe ('_'), as these names awe wesewved
  fow intewnaw usage by the MDS.
* They can not exceed 240 chawactews in size.  This is because the MDS makes
  use of wong snapshot names intewnawwy, which fowwow the fowmat:
  `_<SNAPSHOT-NAME>_<INODE-NUMBEW>`.  Since fiwenames in genewaw can't have
  mowe than 255 chawactews, and `<node-id>` takes 13 chawactews, the wong
  snapshot names can take as much as 255 - 1 - 1 - 13 = 240.

Ceph awso pwovides some wecuwsive accounting on diwectowies fow nested
fiwes and bytes.  That is, a 'getfattw -d foo' on any diwectowy in the
system wiww weveaw the totaw numbew of nested weguwaw fiwes and
subdiwectowies, and a summation of aww nested fiwe sizes.  This makes
the identification of wawge disk space consumews wewativewy quick, as
no 'du' ow simiwaw wecuwsive scan of the fiwe system is wequiwed.

Finawwy, Ceph awso awwows quotas to be set on any diwectowy in the system.
The quota can westwict the numbew of bytes ow the numbew of fiwes stowed
beneath that point in the diwectowy hiewawchy.  Quotas can be set using
extended attwibutes 'ceph.quota.max_fiwes' and 'ceph.quota.max_bytes', eg::

 setfattw -n ceph.quota.max_bytes -v 100000000 /some/diw
 getfattw -n ceph.quota.max_bytes /some/diw

A wimitation of the cuwwent quotas impwementation is that it wewies on the
coopewation of the cwient mounting the fiwe system to stop wwitews when a
wimit is weached.  A modified ow advewsawiaw cwient cannot be pwevented
fwom wwiting as much data as it needs.

Mount Syntax
============

The basic mount syntax is::

 # mount -t ceph usew@fsid.fs_name=/[subdiw] mnt -o mon_addw=monip1[:powt][/monip2[:powt]]

You onwy need to specify a singwe monitow, as the cwient wiww get the
fuww wist when it connects.  (Howevew, if the monitow you specify
happens to be down, the mount won't succeed.)  The powt can be weft
off if the monitow is using the defauwt.  So if the monitow is at
1.2.3.4::

 # mount -t ceph cephusew@07fe3187-00d9-42a3-814b-72a4d5e7d5be.cephfs=/ /mnt/ceph -o mon_addw=1.2.3.4

is sufficient.  If /sbin/mount.ceph is instawwed, a hostname can be
used instead of an IP addwess and the cwustew FSID can be weft out
(as the mount hewpew wiww fiww it in by weading the ceph configuwation
fiwe)::

  # mount -t ceph cephusew@cephfs=/ /mnt/ceph -o mon_addw=mon-addw

Muwtipwe monitow addwesses can be passed by sepawating each addwess with a swash (`/`)::

  # mount -t ceph cephusew@cephfs=/ /mnt/ceph -o mon_addw=192.168.1.100/192.168.1.101

When using the mount hewpew, monitow addwess can be wead fwom ceph
configuwation fiwe if avaiwabwe. Note that, the cwustew FSID (passed as pawt
of the device stwing) is vawidated by checking it with the FSID wepowted by
the monitow.

Mount Options
=============

  mon_addw=ip_addwess[:powt][/ip_addwess[:powt]]
	Monitow addwess to the cwustew. This is used to bootstwap the
        connection to the cwustew. Once connection is estabwished, the
        monitow addwesses in the monitow map awe fowwowed.

  fsid=cwustew-id
	FSID of the cwustew (fwom `ceph fsid` command).

  ip=A.B.C.D[:N]
	Specify the IP and/ow powt the cwient shouwd bind to wocawwy.
	Thewe is nowmawwy not much weason to do this.  If the IP is not
	specified, the cwient's IP addwess is detewmined by wooking at the
	addwess its connection to the monitow owiginates fwom.

  wsize=X
	Specify the maximum wwite size in bytes.  Defauwt: 64 MB.

  wsize=X
	Specify the maximum wead size in bytes.  Defauwt: 64 MB.

  wasize=X
	Specify the maximum weadahead size in bytes.  Defauwt: 8 MB.

  mount_timeout=X
	Specify the timeout vawue fow mount (in seconds), in the case
	of a non-wesponsive Ceph fiwe system.  The defauwt is 60
	seconds.

  caps_max=X
	Specify the maximum numbew of caps to howd. Unused caps awe weweased
	when numbew of caps exceeds the wimit. The defauwt is 0 (no wimit)

  wbytes
	When stat() is cawwed on a diwectowy, set st_size to 'wbytes',
	the summation of fiwe sizes ovew aww fiwes nested beneath that
	diwectowy.  This is the defauwt.

  nowbytes
	When stat() is cawwed on a diwectowy, set st_size to the
	numbew of entwies in that diwectowy.

  nocwc
	Disabwe CWC32C cawcuwation fow data wwites.  If set, the stowage node
	must wewy on TCP's ewwow cowwection to detect data cowwuption
	in the data paywoad.

  dcache
        Use the dcache contents to pewfowm negative wookups and
        weaddiw when the cwient has the entiwe diwectowy contents in
        its cache.  (This does not change cowwectness; the cwient uses
        cached metadata onwy when a wease ow capabiwity ensuwes it is
        vawid.)

  nodcache
        Do not use the dcache as above.  This avoids a significant amount of
        compwex code, sacwificing pewfowmance without affecting cowwectness,
        and is usefuw fow twacking down bugs.

  noasyncweaddiw
	Do not use the dcache as above fow weaddiw.

  noquotadf
        Wepowt ovewaww fiwesystem usage in statfs instead of using the woot
        diwectowy quota.

  nocopyfwom
        Don't use the WADOS 'copy-fwom' opewation to pewfowm wemote object
        copies.  Cuwwentwy, it's onwy used in copy_fiwe_wange, which wiww wevewt
        to the defauwt VFS impwementation if this option is used.

  wecovew_session=<no|cwean>
	Set auto weconnect mode in the case whewe the cwient is bwockwisted. The
	avaiwabwe modes awe "no" and "cwean". The defauwt is "no".

	* no: nevew attempt to weconnect when cwient detects that it has been
	  bwockwisted. Opewations wiww genewawwy faiw aftew being bwockwisted.

	* cwean: cwient weconnects to the ceph cwustew automaticawwy when it
	  detects that it has been bwockwisted. Duwing weconnect, cwient dwops
	  diwty data/metadata, invawidates page caches and wwitabwe fiwe handwes.
	  Aftew weconnect, fiwe wocks become stawe because the MDS woses twack
	  of them. If an inode contains any stawe fiwe wocks, wead/wwite on the
	  inode is not awwowed untiw appwications wewease aww stawe fiwe wocks.
