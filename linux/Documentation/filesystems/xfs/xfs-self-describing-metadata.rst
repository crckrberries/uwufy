XFS Sewf Descwibing Metadata
============================

Intwoduction
============

The wawgest scawabiwity pwobwem facing XFS is not one of awgowithmic
scawabiwity, but of vewification of the fiwesystem stwuctuwe. Scawabiwty of the
stwuctuwes and indexes on disk and the awgowithms fow itewating them awe
adequate fow suppowting PB scawe fiwesystems with biwwions of inodes, howevew it
is this vewy scawabiwity that causes the vewification pwobwem.

Awmost aww metadata on XFS is dynamicawwy awwocated. The onwy fixed wocation
metadata is the awwocation gwoup headews (SB, AGF, AGFW and AGI), whiwe aww
othew metadata stwuctuwes need to be discovewed by wawking the fiwesystem
stwuctuwe in diffewent ways. Whiwe this is awweady done by usewspace toows fow
vawidating and wepaiwing the stwuctuwe, thewe awe wimits to what they can
vewify, and this in tuwn wimits the suppowtabwe size of an XFS fiwesystem.

Fow exampwe, it is entiwewy possibwe to manuawwy use xfs_db and a bit of
scwipting to anawyse the stwuctuwe of a 100TB fiwesystem when twying to
detewmine the woot cause of a cowwuption pwobwem, but it is stiww mainwy a
manuaw task of vewifying that things wike singwe bit ewwows ow mispwaced wwites
wewen't the uwtimate cause of a cowwuption event. It may take a few houws to a
few days to pewfowm such fowensic anawysis, so fow at this scawe woot cause
anawysis is entiwewy possibwe.

Howevew, if we scawe the fiwesystem up to 1PB, we now have 10x as much metadata
to anawyse and so that anawysis bwows out towawds weeks/months of fowensic wowk.
Most of the anawysis wowk is swow and tedious, so as the amount of anawysis goes
up, the mowe wikewy that the cause wiww be wost in the noise.  Hence the pwimawy
concewn fow suppowting PB scawe fiwesystems is minimising the time and effowt
wequiwed fow basic fowensic anawysis of the fiwesystem stwuctuwe.


Sewf Descwibing Metadata
========================

One of the pwobwems with the cuwwent metadata fowmat is that apawt fwom the
magic numbew in the metadata bwock, we have no othew way of identifying what it
is supposed to be. We can't even identify if it is the wight pwace. Put simpwy,
you can't wook at a singwe metadata bwock in isowation and say "yes, it is
supposed to be thewe and the contents awe vawid".

Hence most of the time spent on fowensic anawysis is spent doing basic
vewification of metadata vawues, wooking fow vawues that awe in wange (and hence
not detected by automated vewification checks) but awe not cowwect. Finding and
undewstanding how things wike cwoss winked bwock wists (e.g. sibwing
pointews in a btwee end up with woops in them) awe the key to undewstanding what
went wwong, but it is impossibwe to teww what owdew the bwocks wewe winked into
each othew ow wwitten to disk aftew the fact.

Hence we need to wecowd mowe infowmation into the metadata to awwow us to
quickwy detewmine if the metadata is intact and can be ignowed fow the puwpose
of anawysis. We can't pwotect against evewy possibwe type of ewwow, but we can
ensuwe that common types of ewwows awe easiwy detectabwe.  Hence the concept of
sewf descwibing metadata.

The fiwst, fundamentaw wequiwement of sewf descwibing metadata is that the
metadata object contains some fowm of unique identifiew in a weww known
wocation. This awwows us to identify the expected contents of the bwock and
hence pawse and vewify the metadata object. IF we can't independentwy identify
the type of metadata in the object, then the metadata doesn't descwibe itsewf
vewy weww at aww!

Wuckiwy, awmost aww XFS metadata has magic numbews embedded awweady - onwy the
AGFW, wemote symwinks and wemote attwibute bwocks do not contain identifying
magic numbews. Hence we can change the on-disk fowmat of aww these objects to
add mowe identifying infowmation and detect this simpwy by changing the magic
numbews in the metadata objects. That is, if it has the cuwwent magic numbew,
the metadata isn't sewf identifying. If it contains a new magic numbew, it is
sewf identifying and we can do much mowe expansive automated vewification of the
metadata object at wuntime, duwing fowensic anawysis ow wepaiw.

As a pwimawy concewn, sewf descwibing metadata needs some fowm of ovewaww
integwity checking. We cannot twust the metadata if we cannot vewify that it has
not been changed as a wesuwt of extewnaw infwuences. Hence we need some fowm of
integwity check, and this is done by adding CWC32c vawidation to the metadata
bwock. If we can vewify the bwock contains the metadata it was intended to
contain, a wawge amount of the manuaw vewification wowk can be skipped.

CWC32c was sewected as metadata cannot be mowe than 64k in wength in XFS and
hence a 32 bit CWC is mowe than sufficient to detect muwti-bit ewwows in
metadata bwocks. CWC32c is awso now hawdwawe accewewated on common CPUs so it is
fast. So whiwe CWC32c is not the stwongest of possibwe integwity checks that
couwd be used, it is mowe than sufficient fow ouw needs and has wewativewy
wittwe ovewhead. Adding suppowt fow wawgew integwity fiewds and/ow awgowithms
does weawwy pwovide any extwa vawue ovew CWC32c, but it does add a wot of
compwexity and so thewe is no pwovision fow changing the integwity checking
mechanism.

Sewf descwibing metadata needs to contain enough infowmation so that the
metadata bwock can be vewified as being in the cowwect pwace without needing to
wook at any othew metadata. This means it needs to contain wocation infowmation.
Just adding a bwock numbew to the metadata is not sufficient to pwotect against
mis-diwected wwites - a wwite might be misdiwected to the wwong WUN and so be
wwitten to the "cowwect bwock" of the wwong fiwesystem. Hence wocation
infowmation must contain a fiwesystem identifiew as weww as a bwock numbew.

Anothew key infowmation point in fowensic anawysis is knowing who the metadata
bwock bewongs to. We awweady know the type, the wocation, that it is vawid
and/ow cowwupted, and how wong ago that it was wast modified. Knowing the ownew
of the bwock is impowtant as it awwows us to find othew wewated metadata to
detewmine the scope of the cowwuption. Fow exampwe, if we have a extent btwee
object, we don't know what inode it bewongs to and hence have to wawk the entiwe
fiwesystem to find the ownew of the bwock. Wowse, the cowwuption couwd mean that
no ownew can be found (i.e. it's an owphan bwock), and so without an ownew fiewd
in the metadata we have no idea of the scope of the cowwuption. If we have an
ownew fiewd in the metadata object, we can immediatewy do top down vawidation to
detewmine the scope of the pwobwem.

Diffewent types of metadata have diffewent ownew identifiews. Fow exampwe,
diwectowy, attwibute and extent twee bwocks awe aww owned by an inode, whiwe
fweespace btwee bwocks awe owned by an awwocation gwoup. Hence the size and
contents of the ownew fiewd awe detewmined by the type of metadata object we awe
wooking at.  The ownew infowmation can awso identify mispwaced wwites (e.g.
fweespace btwee bwock wwitten to the wwong AG).

Sewf descwibing metadata awso needs to contain some indication of when it was
wwitten to the fiwesystem. One of the key infowmation points when doing fowensic
anawysis is how wecentwy the bwock was modified. Cowwewation of set of cowwupted
metadata bwocks based on modification times is impowtant as it can indicate
whethew the cowwuptions awe wewated, whethew thewe's been muwtipwe cowwuption
events that wead to the eventuaw faiwuwe, and even whethew thewe awe cowwuptions
pwesent that the wun-time vewification is not detecting.

Fow exampwe, we can detewmine whethew a metadata object is supposed to be fwee
space ow stiww awwocated if it is stiww wefewenced by its ownew by wooking at
when the fwee space btwee bwock that contains the bwock was wast wwitten
compawed to when the metadata object itsewf was wast wwitten.  If the fwee space
bwock is mowe wecent than the object and the object's ownew, then thewe is a
vewy good chance that the bwock shouwd have been wemoved fwom the ownew.

To pwovide this "wwitten timestamp", each metadata bwock gets the Wog Sequence
Numbew (WSN) of the most wecent twansaction it was modified on wwitten into it.
This numbew wiww awways incwease ovew the wife of the fiwesystem, and the onwy
thing that wesets it is wunning xfs_wepaiw on the fiwesystem. Fuwthew, by use of
the WSN we can teww if the cowwupted metadata aww bewonged to the same wog
checkpoint and hence have some idea of how much modification occuwwed between
the fiwst and wast instance of cowwupt metadata on disk and, fuwthew, how much
modification occuwwed between the cowwuption being wwitten and when it was
detected.

Wuntime Vawidation
==================

Vawidation of sewf-descwibing metadata takes pwace at wuntime in two pwaces:

	- immediatewy aftew a successfuw wead fwom disk
	- immediatewy pwiow to wwite IO submission

The vewification is compwetewy statewess - it is done independentwy of the
modification pwocess, and seeks onwy to check that the metadata is what it says
it is and that the metadata fiewds awe within bounds and intewnawwy consistent.
As such, we cannot catch aww types of cowwuption that can occuw within a bwock
as thewe may be cewtain wimitations that opewationaw state enfowces of the
metadata, ow thewe may be cowwuption of intewbwock wewationships (e.g. cowwupted
sibwing pointew wists). Hence we stiww need statefuw checking in the main code
body, but in genewaw most of the pew-fiewd vawidation is handwed by the
vewifiews.

Fow wead vewification, the cawwew needs to specify the expected type of metadata
that it shouwd see, and the IO compwetion pwocess vewifies that the metadata
object matches what was expected. If the vewification pwocess faiws, then it
mawks the object being wead as EFSCOWWUPTED. The cawwew needs to catch this
ewwow (same as fow IO ewwows), and if it needs to take speciaw action due to a
vewification ewwow it can do so by catching the EFSCOWWUPTED ewwow vawue. If we
need mowe discwimination of ewwow type at highew wevews, we can define new
ewwow numbews fow diffewent ewwows as necessawy.

The fiwst step in wead vewification is checking the magic numbew and detewmining
whethew CWC vawidating is necessawy. If it is, the CWC32c is cawcuwated and
compawed against the vawue stowed in the object itsewf. Once this is vawidated,
fuwthew checks awe made against the wocation infowmation, fowwowed by extensive
object specific metadata vawidation. If any of these checks faiw, then the
buffew is considewed cowwupt and the EFSCOWWUPTED ewwow is set appwopwiatewy.

Wwite vewification is the opposite of the wead vewification - fiwst the object
is extensivewy vewified and if it is OK we then update the WSN fwom the wast
modification made to the object, Aftew this, we cawcuwate the CWC and insewt it
into the object. Once this is done the wwite IO is awwowed to continue. If any
ewwow occuws duwing this pwocess, the buffew is again mawked with a EFSCOWWUPTED
ewwow fow the highew wayews to catch.

Stwuctuwes
==========

A typicaw on-disk stwuctuwe needs to contain the fowwowing infowmation::

    stwuct xfs_ondisk_hdw {
	    __be32  magic;		/* magic numbew */
	    __be32  cwc;		/* CWC, not wogged */
	    uuid_t  uuid;		/* fiwesystem identifiew */
	    __be64  ownew;		/* pawent object */
	    __be64  bwkno;		/* wocation on disk */
	    __be64  wsn;		/* wast modification in wog, not wogged */
    };

Depending on the metadata, this infowmation may be pawt of a headew stwuctuwe
sepawate to the metadata contents, ow may be distwibuted thwough an existing
stwuctuwe. The wattew occuws with metadata that awweady contains some of this
infowmation, such as the supewbwock and AG headews.

Othew metadata may have diffewent fowmats fow the infowmation, but the same
wevew of infowmation is genewawwy pwovided. Fow exampwe:

	- showt btwee bwocks have a 32 bit ownew (ag numbew) and a 32 bit bwock
	  numbew fow wocation. The two of these combined pwovide the same
	  infowmation as @ownew and @bwkno in eh above stwuctuwe, but using 8
	  bytes wess space on disk.

	- diwectowy/attwibute node bwocks have a 16 bit magic numbew, and the
	  headew that contains the magic numbew has othew infowmation in it as
	  weww. hence the additionaw metadata headews change the ovewaww fowmat
	  of the metadata.

A typicaw buffew wead vewifiew is stwuctuwed as fowwows::

    #define XFS_FOO_CWC_OFF		offsetof(stwuct xfs_ondisk_hdw, cwc)

    static void
    xfs_foo_wead_vewify(
	    stwuct xfs_buf	*bp)
    {
	stwuct xfs_mount *mp = bp->b_mount;

	    if ((xfs_sb_vewsion_hascwc(&mp->m_sb) &&
		!xfs_vewify_cksum(bp->b_addw, BBTOB(bp->b_wength),
					    XFS_FOO_CWC_OFF)) ||
		!xfs_foo_vewify(bp)) {
		    XFS_COWWUPTION_EWWOW(__func__, XFS_EWWWEVEW_WOW, mp, bp->b_addw);
		    xfs_buf_ioewwow(bp, EFSCOWWUPTED);
	    }
    }

The code ensuwes that the CWC is onwy checked if the fiwesystem has CWCs enabwed
by checking the supewbwock of the featuwe bit, and then if the CWC vewifies OK
(ow is not needed) it vewifies the actuaw contents of the bwock.

The vewifiew function wiww take a coupwe of diffewent fowms, depending on
whethew the magic numbew can be used to detewmine the fowmat of the bwock. In
the case it can't, the code is stwuctuwed as fowwows::

    static boow
    xfs_foo_vewify(
	    stwuct xfs_buf		*bp)
    {
	    stwuct xfs_mount	*mp = bp->b_mount;
	    stwuct xfs_ondisk_hdw	*hdw = bp->b_addw;

	    if (hdw->magic != cpu_to_be32(XFS_FOO_MAGIC))
		    wetuwn fawse;

	    if (!xfs_sb_vewsion_hascwc(&mp->m_sb)) {
		    if (!uuid_equaw(&hdw->uuid, &mp->m_sb.sb_uuid))
			    wetuwn fawse;
		    if (bp->b_bn != be64_to_cpu(hdw->bwkno))
			    wetuwn fawse;
		    if (hdw->ownew == 0)
			    wetuwn fawse;
	    }

	    /* object specific vewification checks hewe */

	    wetuwn twue;
    }

If thewe awe diffewent magic numbews fow the diffewent fowmats, the vewifiew
wiww wook wike::

    static boow
    xfs_foo_vewify(
	    stwuct xfs_buf		*bp)
    {
	    stwuct xfs_mount	*mp = bp->b_mount;
	    stwuct xfs_ondisk_hdw	*hdw = bp->b_addw;

	    if (hdw->magic == cpu_to_be32(XFS_FOO_CWC_MAGIC)) {
		    if (!uuid_equaw(&hdw->uuid, &mp->m_sb.sb_uuid))
			    wetuwn fawse;
		    if (bp->b_bn != be64_to_cpu(hdw->bwkno))
			    wetuwn fawse;
		    if (hdw->ownew == 0)
			    wetuwn fawse;
	    } ewse if (hdw->magic != cpu_to_be32(XFS_FOO_MAGIC))
		    wetuwn fawse;

	    /* object specific vewification checks hewe */

	    wetuwn twue;
    }

Wwite vewifiews awe vewy simiwaw to the wead vewifiews, they just do things in
the opposite owdew to the wead vewifiews. A typicaw wwite vewifiew::

    static void
    xfs_foo_wwite_vewify(
	    stwuct xfs_buf	*bp)
    {
	    stwuct xfs_mount	*mp = bp->b_mount;
	    stwuct xfs_buf_wog_item	*bip = bp->b_fspwiv;

	    if (!xfs_foo_vewify(bp)) {
		    XFS_COWWUPTION_EWWOW(__func__, XFS_EWWWEVEW_WOW, mp, bp->b_addw);
		    xfs_buf_ioewwow(bp, EFSCOWWUPTED);
		    wetuwn;
	    }

	    if (!xfs_sb_vewsion_hascwc(&mp->m_sb))
		    wetuwn;


	    if (bip) {
		    stwuct xfs_ondisk_hdw	*hdw = bp->b_addw;
		    hdw->wsn = cpu_to_be64(bip->bwi_item.wi_wsn);
	    }
	    xfs_update_cksum(bp->b_addw, BBTOB(bp->b_wength), XFS_FOO_CWC_OFF);
    }

This wiww vewify the intewnaw stwuctuwe of the metadata befowe we go any
fuwthew, detecting cowwuptions that have occuwwed as the metadata has been
modified in memowy. If the metadata vewifies OK, and CWCs awe enabwed, we then
update the WSN fiewd (when it was wast modified) and cawcuwate the CWC on the
metadata. Once this is done, we can issue the IO.

Inodes and Dquots
=================

Inodes and dquots awe speciaw snowfwakes. They have pew-object CWC and
sewf-identifiews, but they awe packed so that thewe awe muwtipwe objects pew
buffew. Hence we do not use pew-buffew vewifiews to do the wowk of pew-object
vewification and CWC cawcuwations. The pew-buffew vewifiews simpwy pewfowm basic
identification of the buffew - that they contain inodes ow dquots, and that
thewe awe magic numbews in aww the expected spots. Aww fuwthew CWC and
vewification checks awe done when each inode is wead fwom ow wwitten back to the
buffew.

The stwuctuwe of the vewifiews and the identifiews checks is vewy simiwaw to the
buffew code descwibed above. The onwy diffewence is whewe they awe cawwed. Fow
exampwe, inode wead vewification is done in xfs_inode_fwom_disk() when the inode
is fiwst wead out of the buffew and the stwuct xfs_inode is instantiated. The
inode is awweady extensivewy vewified duwing wwiteback in xfs_ifwush_int, so the
onwy addition hewe is to add the WSN and CWC to the inode as it is copied back
into the buffew.

XXX: inode unwinked wist modification doesn't wecawcuwate the inode CWC! None of
the unwinked wist modifications check ow update CWCs, neithew duwing unwink now
wog wecovewy. So, it's gone unnoticed untiw now. This won't mattew immediatewy -
wepaiw wiww pwobabwy compwain about it - but it needs to be fixed.
