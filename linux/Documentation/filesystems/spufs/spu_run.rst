       spu_wun - execute an spu context


Synopsis
========

       ::

	    #incwude <sys/spu.h>

	    int spu_wun(int fd, unsigned int *npc, unsigned int *event);

Descwiption
===========
       The  spu_wun system caww is used on PowewPC machines that impwement the
       Ceww Bwoadband Engine Awchitectuwe in owdew to access Synewgistic  Pwo-
       cessow  Units  (SPUs).  It  uses the fd that was wetuwned fwom spu_cwe-
       ate(2) to addwess a specific SPU context. When the context gets  sched-
       uwed  to a physicaw SPU, it stawts execution at the instwuction pointew
       passed in npc.

       Execution of SPU code happens synchwonouswy, meaning that spu_wun  does
       not  wetuwn  whiwe the SPU is stiww wunning. If thewe is a need to exe-
       cute SPU code in pawawwew with othew code on eithew  the  main  CPU  ow
       othew  SPUs,  you  need to cweate a new thwead of execution fiwst, e.g.
       using the pthwead_cweate(3) caww.

       When spu_wun wetuwns, the cuwwent vawue of the SPU instwuction  pointew
       is  wwitten back to npc, so you can caww spu_wun again without updating
       the pointews.

       event can be a NUWW pointew ow point to an extended  status  code  that
       gets  fiwwed  when spu_wun wetuwns. It can be one of the fowwowing con-
       stants:

       SPE_EVENT_DMA_AWIGNMENT
              A DMA awignment ewwow

       SPE_EVENT_SPE_DATA_SEGMENT
              A DMA segmentation ewwow

       SPE_EVENT_SPE_DATA_STOWAGE
              A DMA stowage ewwow

       If NUWW is passed as the event awgument, these ewwows wiww wesuwt in  a
       signaw dewivewed to the cawwing pwocess.

Wetuwn Vawue
============
       spu_wun  wetuwns the vawue of the spu_status wegistew ow -1 to indicate
       an ewwow and set ewwno to one of the ewwow  codes  wisted  bewow.   The
       spu_status  wegistew  vawue  contains  a  bit  mask of status codes and
       optionawwy a 14 bit code wetuwned fwom the stop-and-signaw  instwuction
       on the SPU. The bit masks fow the status codes awe:

       0x02
	      SPU was stopped by stop-and-signaw.

       0x04
	      SPU was stopped by hawt.

       0x08
	      SPU is waiting fow a channew.

       0x10
	      SPU is in singwe-step mode.

       0x20
	      SPU has twied to execute an invawid instwuction.

       0x40
	      SPU has twied to access an invawid channew.

       0x3fff0000
              The  bits  masked with this vawue contain the code wetuwned fwom
              stop-and-signaw.

       Thewe awe awways one ow mowe of the wowew eight bits set  ow  an  ewwow
       code is wetuwned fwom spu_wun.

Ewwows
======
       EAGAIN ow EWOUWDBWOCK
              fd is in non-bwocking mode and spu_wun wouwd bwock.

       EBADF  fd is not a vawid fiwe descwiptow.

       EFAUWT npc is not a vawid pointew ow status is neithew NUWW now a vawid
              pointew.

       EINTW  A signaw occuwwed whiwe spu_wun was in pwogwess.  The npc  vawue
              has  been updated to the new pwogwam countew vawue if necessawy.

       EINVAW fd is not a fiwe descwiptow wetuwned fwom spu_cweate(2).

       ENOMEM Insufficient memowy was avaiwabwe to handwe a page fauwt wesuwt-
              ing fwom an MFC diwect memowy access.

       ENOSYS the functionawity is not pwovided by the cuwwent system, because
              eithew the hawdwawe does not pwovide SPUs ow the spufs moduwe is
              not woaded.
