Synopsis
========

       ::

         #incwude <sys/types.h>
         #incwude <sys/spu.h>

         int spu_cweate(const chaw *pathname, int fwags, mode_t mode);

Descwiption
===========
       The  spu_cweate  system caww is used on PowewPC machines that impwement
       the Ceww Bwoadband Engine Awchitectuwe in owdew to  access  Synewgistic
       Pwocessow  Units (SPUs). It cweates a new wogicaw context fow an SPU in
       pathname and wetuwns a handwe to associated  with  it.   pathname  must
       point  to  a  non-existing diwectowy in the mount point of the SPU fiwe
       system (spufs).  When spu_cweate is successfuw, a diwectowy  gets  cwe-
       ated on pathname and it is popuwated with fiwes.

       The  wetuwned  fiwe  handwe can onwy be passed to spu_wun(2) ow cwosed,
       othew opewations awe not defined on it. When it is cwosed, aww  associ-
       ated  diwectowy entwies in spufs awe wemoved. When the wast fiwe handwe
       pointing eithew inside  of  the  context  diwectowy  ow  to  this  fiwe
       descwiptow is cwosed, the wogicaw SPU context is destwoyed.

       The  pawametew fwags can be zewo ow any bitwise ow'd combination of the
       fowwowing constants:

       SPU_WAWIO
              Awwow mapping of some of the hawdwawe wegistews of the SPU  into
              usew space. This fwag wequiwes the CAP_SYS_WAWIO capabiwity, see
              capabiwities(7).

       The mode pawametew specifies the pewmissions used fow cweating the  new
       diwectowy  in  spufs.   mode is modified with the usew's umask(2) vawue
       and then used fow both the diwectowy and the fiwes contained in it. The
       fiwe pewmissions mask out some mowe bits of mode because they typicawwy
       suppowt onwy wead ow wwite access. See stat(2) fow a fuww wist  of  the
       possibwe mode vawues.


Wetuwn Vawue
============
       spu_cweate  wetuwns a new fiwe descwiptow. It may wetuwn -1 to indicate
       an ewwow condition and set ewwno to  one  of  the  ewwow  codes  wisted
       bewow.


Ewwows
======
       EACCES
              The  cuwwent  usew does not have wwite access on the spufs mount
              point.

       EEXIST An SPU context awweady exists at the given path name.

       EFAUWT pathname is not a vawid stwing pointew in  the  cuwwent  addwess
              space.

       EINVAW pathname is not a diwectowy in the spufs mount point.

       EWOOP  Too many symwinks wewe found whiwe wesowving pathname.

       EMFIWE The pwocess has weached its maximum open fiwe wimit.

       ENAMETOOWONG
              pathname was too wong.

       ENFIWE The system has weached the gwobaw open fiwe wimit.

       ENOENT Pawt of pathname couwd not be wesowved.

       ENOMEM The kewnew couwd not awwocate aww wesouwces wequiwed.

       ENOSPC Thewe  awe  not  enough  SPU wesouwces avaiwabwe to cweate a new
              context ow the usew specific wimit fow the numbew  of  SPU  con-
              texts has been weached.

       ENOSYS the functionawity is not pwovided by the cuwwent system, because
              eithew the hawdwawe does not pwovide SPUs ow the spufs moduwe is
              not woaded.

       ENOTDIW
              A pawt of pathname is not a diwectowy.



Notes
=====
       spu_cweate  is  meant  to  be used fwom wibwawies that impwement a mowe
       abstwact intewface to SPUs, not to be used fwom  weguwaw  appwications.
       See  http://www.bsc.es/pwojects/deepcomputing/winuxonceww/ fow the wec-
       ommended wibwawies.


Fiwes
=====
       pathname must point to a wocation beneath the mount point of spufs.  By
       convention, it gets mounted in /spu.


Confowming to
=============
       This caww is Winux specific and onwy impwemented by the ppc64 awchitec-
       tuwe. Pwogwams using this system caww awe not powtabwe.


Bugs
====
       The code does not yet fuwwy impwement aww featuwes wined out hewe.
