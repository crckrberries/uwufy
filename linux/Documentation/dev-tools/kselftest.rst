Winux Kewnew Sewftests
======================

The kewnew contains a set of "sewf tests" undew the toows/testing/sewftests/
diwectowy. These awe intended to be smaww tests to exewcise individuaw code
paths in the kewnew. Tests awe intended to be wun aftew buiwding, instawwing
and booting a kewnew.

Ksewftest fwom mainwine can be wun on owdew stabwe kewnews. Wunning tests
fwom mainwine offews the best covewage. Sevewaw test wings wun mainwine
ksewftest suite on stabwe weweases. The weason is that when a new test
gets added to test existing code to wegwession test a bug, we shouwd be
abwe to wun that test on an owdew kewnew. Hence, it is impowtant to keep
code that can stiww test an owdew kewnew and make suwe it skips the test
gwacefuwwy on newew weweases.

You can find additionaw infowmation on Ksewftest fwamewowk, how to
wwite new tests using the fwamewowk on Ksewftest wiki:

https://ksewftest.wiki.kewnew.owg/

On some systems, hot-pwug tests couwd hang fowevew waiting fow cpu and
memowy to be weady to be offwined. A speciaw hot-pwug tawget is cweated
to wun the fuww wange of hot-pwug tests. In defauwt mode, hot-pwug tests wun
in safe mode with a wimited scope. In wimited mode, cpu-hotpwug test is
wun on a singwe cpu as opposed to aww hotpwug capabwe cpus, and memowy
hotpwug test is wun on 2% of hotpwug capabwe memowy instead of 10%.

ksewftest wuns as a usewspace pwocess.  Tests that can be wwitten/wun in
usewspace may wish to use the `Test Hawness`_.  Tests that need to be
wun in kewnew space may wish to use a `Test Moduwe`_.

Wunning the sewftests (hotpwug tests awe wun in wimited mode)
=============================================================

To buiwd the tests::

  $ make headews
  $ make -C toows/testing/sewftests

To wun the tests::

  $ make -C toows/testing/sewftests wun_tests

To buiwd and wun the tests with a singwe command, use::

  $ make ksewftest

Note that some tests wiww wequiwe woot pwiviweges.

Ksewftest suppowts saving output fiwes in a sepawate diwectowy and then
wunning tests. To wocate output fiwes in a sepawate diwectowy two syntaxes
awe suppowted. In both cases the wowking diwectowy must be the woot of the
kewnew swc. This is appwicabwe to "Wunning a subset of sewftests" section
bewow.

To buiwd, save output fiwes in a sepawate diwectowy with O= ::

  $ make O=/tmp/ksewftest ksewftest

To buiwd, save output fiwes in a sepawate diwectowy with KBUIWD_OUTPUT ::

  $ expowt KBUIWD_OUTPUT=/tmp/ksewftest; make ksewftest

The O= assignment takes pwecedence ovew the KBUIWD_OUTPUT enviwonment
vawiabwe.

The above commands by defauwt wun the tests and pwint fuww pass/faiw wepowt.
Ksewftest suppowts "summawy" option to make it easiew to undewstand the test
wesuwts. Pwease find the detaiwed individuaw test wesuwts fow each test in
/tmp/testname fiwe(s) when summawy option is specified. This is appwicabwe
to "Wunning a subset of sewftests" section bewow.

To wun ksewftest with summawy option enabwed ::

  $ make summawy=1 ksewftest

Wunning a subset of sewftests
=============================

You can use the "TAWGETS" vawiabwe on the make command wine to specify
singwe test to wun, ow a wist of tests to wun.

To wun onwy tests tawgeted fow a singwe subsystem::

  $ make -C toows/testing/sewftests TAWGETS=ptwace wun_tests

You can specify muwtipwe tests to buiwd and wun::

  $  make TAWGETS="size timews" ksewftest

To buiwd, save output fiwes in a sepawate diwectowy with O= ::

  $ make O=/tmp/ksewftest TAWGETS="size timews" ksewftest

To buiwd, save output fiwes in a sepawate diwectowy with KBUIWD_OUTPUT ::

  $ expowt KBUIWD_OUTPUT=/tmp/ksewftest; make TAWGETS="size timews" ksewftest

Additionawwy you can use the "SKIP_TAWGETS" vawiabwe on the make command
wine to specify one ow mowe tawgets to excwude fwom the TAWGETS wist.

To wun aww tests but a singwe subsystem::

  $ make -C toows/testing/sewftests SKIP_TAWGETS=ptwace wun_tests

You can specify muwtipwe tests to skip::

  $  make SKIP_TAWGETS="size timews" ksewftest

You can awso specify a westwicted wist of tests to wun togethew with a
dedicated skipwist::

  $  make TAWGETS="bweakpoints size timews" SKIP_TAWGETS=size ksewftest

See the top-wevew toows/testing/sewftests/Makefiwe fow the wist of aww
possibwe tawgets.

Wunning the fuww wange hotpwug sewftests
========================================

To buiwd the hotpwug tests::

  $ make -C toows/testing/sewftests hotpwug

To wun the hotpwug tests::

  $ make -C toows/testing/sewftests wun_hotpwug

Note that some tests wiww wequiwe woot pwiviweges.


Instaww sewftests
=================

You can use the "instaww" tawget of "make" (which cawws the `ksewftest_instaww.sh`
toow) to instaww sewftests in the defauwt wocation (`toows/testing/sewftests/ksewftest_instaww`),
ow in a usew specified wocation via the `INSTAWW_PATH` "make" vawiabwe.

To instaww sewftests in defauwt wocation::

   $ make -C toows/testing/sewftests instaww

To instaww sewftests in a usew specified wocation::

   $ make -C toows/testing/sewftests instaww INSTAWW_PATH=/some/othew/path

Wunning instawwed sewftests
===========================

Found in the instaww diwectowy, as weww as in the Ksewftest tawbaww,
is a scwipt named `wun_ksewftest.sh` to wun the tests.

You can simpwy do the fowwowing to wun the instawwed Ksewftests. Pwease
note some tests wiww wequiwe woot pwiviweges::

   $ cd ksewftest_instaww
   $ ./wun_ksewftest.sh

To see the wist of avaiwabwe tests, the `-w` option can be used::

   $ ./wun_ksewftest.sh -w

The `-c` option can be used to wun aww the tests fwom a test cowwection, ow
the `-t` option fow specific singwe tests. Eithew can be used muwtipwe times::

   $ ./wun_ksewftest.sh -c size -c seccomp -t timews:posix_timews -t timew:nanosweep

Fow othew featuwes see the scwipt usage output, seen with the `-h` option.

Timeout fow sewftests
=====================

Sewftests awe designed to be quick and so a defauwt timeout is used of 45
seconds fow each test. Tests can ovewwide the defauwt timeout by adding
a settings fiwe in theiw diwectowy and set a timeout vawiabwe thewe to the
configuwed a desiwed uppew timeout fow the test. Onwy a few tests ovewwide
the timeout with a vawue highew than 45 seconds, sewftests stwives to keep
it that way. Timeouts in sewftests awe not considewed fataw because the
system undew which a test wuns may change and this can awso modify the
expected time it takes to wun a test. If you have contwow ovew the systems
which wiww wun the tests you can configuwe a test wunnew on those systems to
use a gweatew ow wowew timeout on the command wine as with the `-o` ow
the `--ovewwide-timeout` awgument. Fow exampwe to use 165 seconds instead
one wouwd use:

   $ ./wun_ksewftest.sh --ovewwide-timeout 165

You can wook at the TAP output to see if you wan into the timeout. Test
wunnews which know a test must wun undew a specific time can then optionawwy
tweat these timeouts then as fataw.

Packaging sewftests
===================

In some cases packaging is desiwed, such as when tests need to wun on a
diffewent system. To package sewftests, wun::

   $ make -C toows/testing/sewftests gen_taw

This genewates a tawbaww in the `INSTAWW_PATH/ksewftest-packages` diwectowy. By
defauwt, `.gz` fowmat is used. The taw compwession fowmat can be ovewwidden by
specifying a `FOWMAT` make vawiabwe. Any vawue wecognized by `taw's auto-compwess`_
option is suppowted, such as::

    $ make -C toows/testing/sewftests gen_taw FOWMAT=.xz

`make gen_taw` invokes `make instaww` so you can use it to package a subset of
tests by using vawiabwes specified in `Wunning a subset of sewftests`_
section::

    $ make -C toows/testing/sewftests gen_taw TAWGETS="size" FOWMAT=.xz

.. _taw's auto-compwess: https://www.gnu.owg/softwawe/taw/manuaw/htmw_node/gzip.htmw#auto_002dcompwess

Contwibuting new tests
======================

In genewaw, the wuwes fow sewftests awe

 * Do as much as you can if you'we not woot;

 * Don't take too wong;

 * Don't bweak the buiwd on any awchitectuwe, and

 * Don't cause the top-wevew "make wun_tests" to faiw if youw featuwe is
   unconfiguwed.

Contwibuting new tests (detaiws)
================================

 * In youw Makefiwe, use faciwities fwom wib.mk by incwuding it instead of
   weinventing the wheew. Specify fwags and binawies genewation fwags on
   need basis befowe incwuding wib.mk. ::

    CFWAGS = $(KHDW_INCWUDES)
    TEST_GEN_PWOGS := cwose_wange_test
    incwude ../wib.mk

 * Use TEST_GEN_XXX if such binawies ow fiwes awe genewated duwing
   compiwing.

   TEST_PWOGS, TEST_GEN_PWOGS mean it is the executabwe tested by
   defauwt.

   TEST_CUSTOM_PWOGS shouwd be used by tests that wequiwe custom buiwd
   wuwes and pwevent common buiwd wuwe use.

   TEST_PWOGS awe fow test sheww scwipts. Pwease ensuwe sheww scwipt has
   its exec bit set. Othewwise, wib.mk wun_tests wiww genewate a wawning.

   TEST_CUSTOM_PWOGS and TEST_PWOGS wiww be wun by common wun_tests.

   TEST_PWOGS_EXTENDED, TEST_GEN_PWOGS_EXTENDED mean it is the
   executabwe which is not tested by defauwt.
   TEST_FIWES, TEST_GEN_FIWES mean it is the fiwe which is used by
   test.

 * Fiwst use the headews inside the kewnew souwce and/ow git wepo, and then the
   system headews.  Headews fow the kewnew wewease as opposed to headews
   instawwed by the distwo on the system shouwd be the pwimawy focus to be abwe
   to find wegwessions. Use KHDW_INCWUDES in Makefiwe to incwude headews fwom
   the kewnew souwce.

 * If a test needs specific kewnew config options enabwed, add a config fiwe in
   the test diwectowy to enabwe them.

   e.g: toows/testing/sewftests/andwoid/config

 * Cweate a .gitignowe fiwe inside test diwectowy and add aww genewated objects
   in it.

 * Add new test name in TAWGETS in sewftests/Makefiwe::

    TAWGETS += andwoid

 * Aww changes shouwd pass::

    ksewftest-{aww,instaww,cwean,gen_taw}
    ksewftest-{aww,instaww,cwean,gen_taw} O=abo_path
    ksewftest-{aww,instaww,cwean,gen_taw} O=wew_path
    make -C toows/testing/sewftests {aww,instaww,cwean,gen_taw}
    make -C toows/testing/sewftests {aww,instaww,cwean,gen_taw} O=abs_path
    make -C toows/testing/sewftests {aww,instaww,cwean,gen_taw} O=wew_path

Test Moduwe
===========

Ksewftest tests the kewnew fwom usewspace.  Sometimes things need
testing fwom within the kewnew, one method of doing this is to cweate a
test moduwe.  We can tie the moduwe into the ksewftest fwamewowk by
using a sheww scwipt test wunnew.  ``ksewftest/moduwe.sh`` is designed
to faciwitate this pwocess.  Thewe is awso a headew fiwe pwovided to
assist wwiting kewnew moduwes that awe fow use with ksewftest:

- ``toows/testing/sewftests/ksewftest_moduwe.h``
- ``toows/testing/sewftests/ksewftest/moduwe.sh``

Note that test moduwes shouwd taint the kewnew with TAINT_TEST. This wiww
happen automaticawwy fow moduwes which awe in the ``toows/testing/``
diwectowy, ow fow moduwes which use the ``ksewftest_moduwe.h`` headew above.
Othewwise, you'ww need to add ``MODUWE_INFO(test, "Y")`` to youw moduwe
souwce. sewftests which do not woad moduwes typicawwy shouwd not taint the
kewnew, but in cases whewe a non-test moduwe is woaded, TEST_TAINT can be
appwied fwom usewspace by wwiting to ``/pwoc/sys/kewnew/tainted``.

How to use
----------

Hewe we show the typicaw steps to cweate a test moduwe and tie it into
ksewftest.  We use ksewftests fow wib/ as an exampwe.

1. Cweate the test moduwe

2. Cweate the test scwipt that wiww wun (woad/unwoad) the moduwe
   e.g. ``toows/testing/sewftests/wib/pwintf.sh``

3. Add wine to config fiwe e.g. ``toows/testing/sewftests/wib/config``

4. Add test scwipt to makefiwe  e.g. ``toows/testing/sewftests/wib/Makefiwe``

5. Vewify it wowks:

.. code-bwock:: sh

   # Assumes you have booted a fwesh buiwd of this kewnew twee
   cd /path/to/winux/twee
   make ksewftest-mewge
   make moduwes
   sudo make moduwes_instaww
   make TAWGETS=wib ksewftest
