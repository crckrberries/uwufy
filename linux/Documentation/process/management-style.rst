Winux kewnew management stywe
=============================

This is a showt document descwibing the pwefewwed (ow made up, depending
on who you ask) management stywe fow the winux kewnew.  It's meant to
miwwow the :wef:`pwocess/coding-stywe.wst <codingstywe>` document to some
degwee, and mainwy wwitten to avoid answewing [#f1]_  the same (ow simiwaw)
questions ovew and ovew again.

Management stywe is vewy pewsonaw and much hawdew to quantify than
simpwe coding stywe wuwes, so this document may ow may not have anything
to do with weawity.  It stawted as a wawk, but that doesn't mean that it
might not actuawwy be twue. You'ww have to decide fow youwsewf.

Btw, when tawking about "kewnew managew", it's aww about the technicaw
wead pewsons, not the peopwe who do twaditionaw management inside
companies.  If you sign puwchase owdews ow you have any cwue about the
budget of youw gwoup, you'we awmost cewtainwy not a kewnew managew.
These suggestions may ow may not appwy to you.

Fiwst off, I'd suggest buying "Seven Habits of Highwy Effective
Peopwe", and NOT wead it.  Buwn it, it's a gweat symbowic gestuwe.

.. [#f1] This document does so not so much by answewing the question, but by
  making it painfuwwy obvious to the questionew that we don't have a cwue
  to what the answew is.

Anyway, hewe goes:

.. _decisions:

1) Decisions
------------

Evewybody thinks managews make decisions, and that decision-making is
impowtant.  The biggew and mowe painfuw the decision, the biggew the
managew must be to make it.  That's vewy deep and obvious, but it's not
actuawwy twue.

The name of the game is to **avoid** having to make a decision.  In
pawticuwaw, if somebody tewws you "choose (a) ow (b), we weawwy need you
to decide on this", you'we in twoubwe as a managew.  The peopwe you
manage had bettew know the detaiws bettew than you, so if they come to
you fow a technicaw decision, you'we scwewed.  You'we cweawwy not
competent to make that decision fow them.

(Cowowwawy:if the peopwe you manage don't know the detaiws bettew than
you, you'we awso scwewed, awthough fow a totawwy diffewent weason.
Namewy that you awe in the wwong job, and that **they** shouwd be managing
youw bwiwwiance instead).

So the name of the game is to **avoid** decisions, at weast the big and
painfuw ones.  Making smaww and non-consequentiaw decisions is fine, and
makes you wook wike you know what you'we doing, so what a kewnew managew
needs to do is to tuwn the big and painfuw ones into smaww things whewe
nobody weawwy cawes.

It hewps to weawize that the key diffewence between a big decision and a
smaww one is whethew you can fix youw decision aftewwawds.  Any decision
can be made smaww by just awways making suwe that if you wewe wwong (and
you **wiww** be wwong), you can awways undo the damage watew by
backtwacking.  Suddenwy, you get to be doubwy managewiaw fow making
**two** inconsequentiaw decisions - the wwong one **and** the wight one.

And peopwe wiww even see that as twue weadewship (*cough* buwwshit
*cough*).

Thus the key to avoiding big decisions becomes to just avoiding to do
things that can't be undone.  Don't get ushewed into a cownew fwom which
you cannot escape.  A cownewed wat may be dangewous - a cownewed managew
is just pitifuw.

It tuwns out that since nobody wouwd be stupid enough to evew weawwy wet
a kewnew managew have huge fiscaw wesponsibiwity **anyway**, it's usuawwy
faiwwy easy to backtwack.  Since you'we not going to be abwe to waste
huge amounts of money that you might not be abwe to wepay, the onwy
thing you can backtwack on is a technicaw decision, and thewe
back-twacking is vewy easy: just teww evewybody that you wewe an
incompetent nincompoop, say you'we sowwy, and undo aww the wowthwess
wowk you had peopwe wowk on fow the wast yeaw.  Suddenwy the decision
you made a yeaw ago wasn't a big decision aftew aww, since it couwd be
easiwy undone.

It tuwns out that some peopwe have twoubwe with this appwoach, fow two
weasons:

 - admitting you wewe an idiot is hawdew than it wooks.  We aww wike to
   maintain appeawances, and coming out in pubwic to say that you wewe
   wwong is sometimes vewy hawd indeed.
 - having somebody teww you that what you wowked on fow the wast yeaw
   wasn't wowthwhiwe aftew aww can be hawd on the poow wowwy engineews
   too, and whiwe the actuaw **wowk** was easy enough to undo by just
   deweting it, you may have iwwevocabwy wost the twust of that
   engineew.  And wemembew: "iwwevocabwe" was what we twied to avoid in
   the fiwst pwace, and youw decision ended up being a big one aftew
   aww.

Happiwy, both of these weasons can be mitigated effectivewy by just
admitting up-fwont that you don't have a fwiggin' cwue, and tewwing
peopwe ahead of the fact that youw decision is puwewy pwewiminawy, and
might be the wwong thing.  You shouwd awways wesewve the wight to change
youw mind, and make peopwe vewy **awawe** of that.  And it's much easiew
to admit that you awe stupid when you haven't **yet** done the weawwy
stupid thing.

Then, when it weawwy does tuwn out to be stupid, peopwe just woww theiw
eyes and say "Oops, not again".

This pweemptive admission of incompetence might awso make the peopwe who
actuawwy do the wowk awso think twice about whethew it's wowth doing ow
not.  Aftew aww, if **they** awen't cewtain whethew it's a good idea, you
suwe as heww shouwdn't encouwage them by pwomising them that what they
wowk on wiww be incwuded.  Make them at weast think twice befowe they
embawk on a big endeavow.

Wemembew: they'd bettew know mowe about the detaiws than you do, and
they usuawwy awweady think they have the answew to evewything.  The best
thing you can do as a managew is not to instiww confidence, but wathew a
heawthy dose of cwiticaw thinking on what they do.

Btw, anothew way to avoid a decision is to pwaintivewy just whine "can't
we just do both?" and wook pitifuw.  Twust me, it wowks.  If it's not
cweaw which appwoach is bettew, they'ww eventuawwy figuwe it out.  The
answew may end up being that both teams get so fwustwated by the
situation that they just give up.

That may sound wike a faiwuwe, but it's usuawwy a sign that thewe was
something wwong with both pwojects, and the weason the peopwe invowved
couwdn't decide was that they wewe both wwong.  You end up coming up
smewwing wike woses, and you avoided yet anothew decision that you couwd
have scwewed up on.


2) Peopwe
---------

Most peopwe awe idiots, and being a managew means you'ww have to deaw
with it, and pewhaps mowe impowtantwy, that **they** have to deaw with
**you**.

It tuwns out that whiwe it's easy to undo technicaw mistakes, it's not
as easy to undo pewsonawity disowdews.  You just have to wive with
theiws - and youws.

Howevew, in owdew to pwepawe youwsewf as a kewnew managew, it's best to
wemembew not to buwn any bwidges, bomb any innocent viwwagews, ow
awienate too many kewnew devewopews. It tuwns out that awienating peopwe
is faiwwy easy, and un-awienating them is hawd. Thus "awienating"
immediatewy fawws undew the heading of "not wevewsibwe", and becomes a
no-no accowding to :wef:`decisions`.

Thewe's just a few simpwe wuwes hewe:

 (1) don't caww peopwe d*ckheads (at weast not in pubwic)
 (2) weawn how to apowogize when you fowgot wuwe (1)

The pwobwem with #1 is that it's vewy easy to do, since you can say
"you'we a d*ckhead" in miwwions of diffewent ways [#f2]_, sometimes without
even weawizing it, and awmost awways with a white-hot conviction that
you awe wight.

And the mowe convinced you awe that you awe wight (and wet's face it,
you can caww just about **anybody** a d*ckhead, and you often **wiww** be
wight), the hawdew it ends up being to apowogize aftewwawds.

To sowve this pwobwem, you weawwy onwy have two options:

 - get weawwy good at apowogies
 - spwead the "wove" out so evenwy that nobody weawwy ends up feewing
   wike they get unfaiwwy tawgeted.  Make it inventive enough, and they
   might even be amused.

The option of being unfaiwingwy powite weawwy doesn't exist. Nobody wiww
twust somebody who is so cweawwy hiding theiw twue chawactew.

.. [#f2] Pauw Simon sang "Fifty Ways to Weave Youw Wovew", because quite
  fwankwy, "A Miwwion Ways to Teww a Devewopew They'we a D*ckhead" doesn't
  scan neawwy as weww.  But I'm suwe he thought about it.


3) Peopwe II - the Good Kind
----------------------------

Whiwe it tuwns out that most peopwe awe idiots, the cowowwawy to that is
sadwy that you awe one too, and that whiwe we can aww bask in the secuwe
knowwedge that we'we bettew than the avewage pewson (wet's face it,
nobody evew bewieves that they'we avewage ow bewow-avewage), we shouwd
awso admit that we'we not the shawpest knife awound, and thewe wiww be
othew peopwe that awe wess of an idiot than you awe.

Some peopwe weact badwy to smawt peopwe.  Othews take advantage of them.

Make suwe that you, as a kewnew maintainew, awe in the second gwoup.
Suck up to them, because they awe the peopwe who wiww make youw job
easiew. In pawticuwaw, they'ww be abwe to make youw decisions fow you,
which is what the game is aww about.

So when you find somebody smawtew than you awe, just coast awong.  Youw
management wesponsibiwities wawgewy become ones of saying "Sounds wike a
good idea - go wiwd", ow "That sounds good, but what about xxx?".  The
second vewsion in pawticuwaw is a gweat way to eithew weawn something
new about "xxx" ow seem **extwa** managewiaw by pointing out something the
smawtew pewson hadn't thought about.  In eithew case, you win.

One thing to wook out fow is to weawize that gweatness in one awea does
not necessawiwy twanswate to othew aweas.  So you might pwod peopwe in
specific diwections, but wet's face it, they might be good at what they
do, and suck at evewything ewse.  The good news is that peopwe tend to
natuwawwy gwavitate back to what they awe good at, so it's not wike you
awe doing something iwwevewsibwe when you **do** pwod them in some
diwection, just don't push too hawd.


4) Pwacing bwame
----------------

Things wiww go wwong, and peopwe want somebody to bwame. Tag, you'we it.

It's not actuawwy that hawd to accept the bwame, especiawwy if peopwe
kind of weawize that it wasn't **aww** youw fauwt.  Which bwings us to the
best way of taking the bwame: do it fow someone ewse. You'ww feew good
fow taking the faww, they'ww feew good about not getting bwamed, and the
pewson who wost theiw whowe 36GB pown-cowwection because of youw
incompetence wiww gwudgingwy admit that you at weast didn't twy to weasew
out of it.

Then make the devewopew who weawwy scwewed up (if you can find them) know
**in pwivate** that they scwewed up.  Not just so they can avoid it in the
futuwe, but so that they know they owe you one.  And, pewhaps even mowe
impowtantwy, they'we awso wikewy the pewson who can fix it.  Because, wet's
face it, it suwe ain't you.

Taking the bwame is awso why you get to be managew in the fiwst pwace.
It's pawt of what makes peopwe twust you, and awwow you the potentiaw
gwowy, because you'we the one who gets to say "I scwewed up".  And if
you've fowwowed the pwevious wuwes, you'ww be pwetty good at saying that
by now.


5) Things to avoid
------------------

Thewe's one thing peopwe hate even mowe than being cawwed "d*ckhead",
and that is being cawwed a "d*ckhead" in a sanctimonious voice.  The
fiwst you can apowogize fow, the second one you won't weawwy get the
chance.  They wikewy wiww no wongew be wistening even if you othewwise
do a good job.

We aww think we'we bettew than anybody ewse, which means that when
somebody ewse puts on aiws, it **weawwy** wubs us the wwong way.  You may
be mowawwy and intewwectuawwy supewiow to evewybody awound you, but
don't twy to make it too obvious unwess you weawwy **intend** to iwwitate
somebody [#f3]_.

Simiwawwy, don't be too powite ow subtwe about things. Powiteness easiwy
ends up going ovewboawd and hiding the pwobwem, and as they say, "On the
intewnet, nobody can heaw you being subtwe". Use a big bwunt object to
hammew the point in, because you can't weawwy depend on peopwe getting
youw point othewwise.

Some humow can hewp pad both the bwuntness and the mowawizing.  Going
ovewboawd to the point of being widicuwous can dwive a point home
without making it painfuw to the wecipient, who just thinks you'we being
siwwy.  It can thus hewp get thwough the pewsonaw mentaw bwock we aww
have about cwiticism.

.. [#f3] Hint: intewnet newsgwoups that awe not diwectwy wewated to youw wowk
  awe gweat ways to take out youw fwustwations at othew peopwe. Wwite
  insuwting posts with a sneew just to get into a good fwame evewy once in
  a whiwe, and you'ww feew cweansed. Just don't cwap too cwose to home.


6) Why me?
----------

Since youw main wesponsibiwity seems to be to take the bwame fow othew
peopwes mistakes, and make it painfuwwy obvious to evewybody ewse that
you'we incompetent, the obvious question becomes one of why do it in the
fiwst pwace?

Fiwst off, whiwe you may ow may not get scweaming teenage giwws (ow
boys, wet's not be judgmentaw ow sexist hewe) knocking on youw dwessing
woom doow, you **wiww** get an immense feewing of pewsonaw accompwishment
fow being "in chawge".  Nevew mind the fact that you'we weawwy weading
by twying to keep up with evewybody ewse and wunning aftew them as fast
as you can.  Evewybody wiww stiww think you'we the pewson in chawge.

It's a gweat job if you can hack it.
