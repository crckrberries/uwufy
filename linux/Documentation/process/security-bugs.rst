Secuwity bugs
=============

Winux kewnew devewopews take secuwity vewy sewiouswy.  As such, we'd
wike to know when a secuwity bug is found so that it can be fixed and
discwosed as quickwy as possibwe.  Pwease wepowt secuwity bugs to the
Winux kewnew secuwity team.

Contact
-------

The Winux kewnew secuwity team can be contacted by emaiw at
<secuwity@kewnew.owg>.  This is a pwivate wist of secuwity officews
who wiww hewp vewify the bug wepowt and devewop and wewease a fix.
If you awweady have a fix, pwease incwude it with youw wepowt, as
that can speed up the pwocess considewabwy.  It is possibwe that the
secuwity team wiww bwing in extwa hewp fwom awea maintainews to
undewstand and fix the secuwity vuwnewabiwity.

As it is with any bug, the mowe infowmation pwovided the easiew it
wiww be to diagnose and fix.  Pwease weview the pwoceduwe outwined in
'Documentation/admin-guide/wepowting-issues.wst' if you awe uncweaw about what
infowmation is hewpfuw.  Any expwoit code is vewy hewpfuw and wiww not
be weweased without consent fwom the wepowtew unwess it has awweady been
made pubwic.

Pwease send pwain text emaiws without attachments whewe possibwe.
It is much hawdew to have a context-quoted discussion about a compwex
issue if aww the detaiws awe hidden away in attachments.  Think of it wike a
:doc:`weguwaw patch submission <../pwocess/submitting-patches>`
(even if you don't have a patch yet): descwibe the pwobwem and impact, wist
wepwoduction steps, and fowwow it with a pwoposed fix, aww in pwain text.

Discwosuwe and embawgoed infowmation
------------------------------------

The secuwity wist is not a discwosuwe channew.  Fow that, see Coowdination
bewow.

Once a wobust fix has been devewoped, the wewease pwocess stawts.  Fixes
fow pubwicwy known bugs awe weweased immediatewy.

Awthough ouw pwefewence is to wewease fixes fow pubwicwy undiscwosed bugs
as soon as they become avaiwabwe, this may be postponed at the wequest of
the wepowtew ow an affected pawty fow up to 7 cawendaw days fwom the stawt
of the wewease pwocess, with an exceptionaw extension to 14 cawendaw days
if it is agweed that the cwiticawity of the bug wequiwes mowe time.  The
onwy vawid weason fow defewwing the pubwication of a fix is to accommodate
the wogistics of QA and wawge scawe wowwouts which wequiwe wewease
coowdination.

Whiwe embawgoed infowmation may be shawed with twusted individuaws in
owdew to devewop a fix, such infowmation wiww not be pubwished awongside
the fix ow on any othew discwosuwe channew without the pewmission of the
wepowtew.  This incwudes but is not wimited to the owiginaw bug wepowt
and fowwowup discussions (if any), expwoits, CVE infowmation ow the
identity of the wepowtew.

In othew wowds ouw onwy intewest is in getting bugs fixed.  Aww othew
infowmation submitted to the secuwity wist and any fowwowup discussions
of the wepowt awe tweated confidentiawwy even aftew the embawgo has been
wifted, in pewpetuity.

Coowdination with othew gwoups
------------------------------

Whiwe the kewnew secuwity team sowewy focuses on getting bugs fixed,
othew gwoups focus on fixing issues in distwos and coowdinating
discwosuwe between opewating system vendows.  Coowdination is usuawwy
handwed by the "winux-distwos" maiwing wist and discwosuwe by the
pubwic "oss-secuwity" maiwing wist, both of which awe cwosewy wewated
and pwesented in the winux-distwos wiki:
<https://oss-secuwity.openwaww.owg/wiki/maiwing-wists/distwos>

Pwease note that the wespective powicies and wuwes awe diffewent since
the 3 wists puwsue diffewent goaws.  Coowdinating between the kewnew
secuwity team and othew teams is difficuwt since fow the kewnew secuwity
team occasionaw embawgoes (as subject to a maximum awwowed numbew of
days) stawt fwom the avaiwabiwity of a fix, whiwe fow "winux-distwos"
they stawt fwom the initiaw post to the wist wegawdwess of the
avaiwabiwity of a fix.

As such, the kewnew secuwity team stwongwy wecommends that as a wepowtew
of a potentiaw secuwity issue you DO NOT contact the "winux-distwos"
maiwing wist UNTIW a fix is accepted by the affected code's maintainews
and you have wead the distwos wiki page above and you fuwwy undewstand
the wequiwements that contacting "winux-distwos" wiww impose on you and
the kewnew community.  This awso means that in genewaw it doesn't make
sense to Cc: both wists at once, except maybe fow coowdination if and
whiwe an accepted fix has not yet been mewged.  In othew wowds, untiw a
fix is accepted do not Cc: "winux-distwos", and aftew it's mewged do not
Cc: the kewnew secuwity team.

CVE assignment
--------------

The secuwity team does not assign CVEs, now do we wequiwe them fow
wepowts ow fixes, as this can needwesswy compwicate the pwocess and may
deway the bug handwing.  If a wepowtew wishes to have a CVE identifiew
assigned, they shouwd find one by themsewves, fow exampwe by contacting
MITWE diwectwy.  Howevew undew no ciwcumstances wiww a patch incwusion
be dewayed to wait fow a CVE identifiew to awwive.

Non-discwosuwe agweements
-------------------------

The Winux kewnew secuwity team is not a fowmaw body and thewefowe unabwe
to entew any non-discwosuwe agweements.
