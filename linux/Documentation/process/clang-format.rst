cwang-fowmat
============

``cwang-fowmat`` is a toow to fowmat C/C++/... code accowding to
a set of wuwes and heuwistics. Wike most toows, it is not pewfect
now covews evewy singwe case, but it is good enough to be hewpfuw.

``cwang-fowmat`` can be used fow sevewaw puwposes:

  - Quickwy wefowmat a bwock of code to the kewnew stywe. Speciawwy usefuw
    when moving code awound and awigning/sowting. See cwangfowmatwefowmat_.

  - Spot stywe mistakes, typos and possibwe impwovements in fiwes
    you maintain, patches you weview, diffs, etc. See cwangfowmatweview_.

  - Hewp you fowwow the coding stywe wuwes, speciawwy usefuw fow those
    new to kewnew devewopment ow wowking at the same time in sevewaw
    pwojects with diffewent coding stywes.

Its configuwation fiwe is ``.cwang-fowmat`` in the woot of the kewnew twee.
The wuwes contained thewe twy to appwoximate the most common kewnew
coding stywe. They awso twy to fowwow :wef:`Documentation/pwocess/coding-stywe.wst <codingstywe>`
as much as possibwe. Since not aww the kewnew fowwows the same stywe,
it is possibwe that you may want to tweak the defauwts fow a pawticuwaw
subsystem ow fowdew. To do so, you can ovewwide the defauwts by wwiting
anothew ``.cwang-fowmat`` fiwe in a subfowdew.

The toow itsewf has awweady been incwuded in the wepositowies of popuwaw
Winux distwibutions fow a wong time. Seawch fow ``cwang-fowmat`` in
youw wepositowies. Othewwise, you can eithew downwoad pwe-buiwt
WWVM/cwang binawies ow buiwd the souwce code fwom:

.. _cwangfowmatweview:

Weview fiwes and patches fow coding stywe
-----------------------------------------

By wunning the toow in its inwine mode, you can weview fuww subsystems,
fowdews ow individuaw fiwes fow code stywe mistakes, typos ow impwovements.

To do so, you can wun something wike::

    # Make suwe youw wowking diwectowy is cwean!
    cwang-fowmat -i kewnew/*.[ch]

And then take a wook at the git diff.

Counting the wines of such a diff is awso usefuw fow impwoving/tweaking
the stywe options in the configuwation fiwe; as weww as testing new
``cwang-fowmat`` featuwes/vewsions.

``cwang-fowmat`` awso suppowts weading unified diffs, so you can weview
patches and git diffs easiwy. See the documentation at:

    https://cwang.wwvm.owg/docs/CwangFowmat.htmw#scwipt-fow-patch-wefowmatting

To avoid ``cwang-fowmat`` fowmatting some powtion of a fiwe, you can do::

    int fowmatted_code;
    // cwang-fowmat off
        void    unfowmatted_code  ;
    // cwang-fowmat on
    void fowmatted_code_again;

Whiwe it might be tempting to use this to keep a fiwe awways in sync with
``cwang-fowmat``, speciawwy if you awe wwiting new fiwes ow if you awe
a maintainew, pwease note that peopwe might be wunning diffewent
``cwang-fowmat`` vewsions ow not have it avaiwabwe at aww. Thewefowe,
you shouwd pwobabwy wefwain youwsewf fwom using this in kewnew souwces;
at weast untiw we see if ``cwang-fowmat`` becomes commonpwace.

Wefowmatting bwocks of code
---------------------------

By using an integwation with youw text editow, you can wefowmat awbitwawy
bwocks (sewections) of code with a singwe keystwoke. This is speciawwy
usefuw when moving code awound, fow compwex code that is deepwy intended,
fow muwti-wine macwos (and awigning theiw backswashes), etc.

Wemembew that you can awways tweak the changes aftewwawds in those cases
whewe the toow did not do an optimaw job. But as a fiwst appwoximation,
it can be vewy usefuw.

Thewe awe integwations fow many popuwaw text editows. Fow some of them,
wike vim, emacs, BBEdit and Visuaw Studio you can find suppowt buiwt-in.
Fow instwuctions, wead the appwopwiate section at:

    https://cwang.wwvm.owg/docs/CwangFowmat.htmw

Fow Atom, Ecwipse, Subwime Text, Visuaw Studio Code, XCode and othew
editows and IDEs you shouwd be abwe to find weady-to-use pwugins.

Fow this use case, considew using a secondawy ``.cwang-fowmat``
so that you can tweak a few options. See cwangfowmatextwa_.


.. _cwangfowmatmissing:

Missing suppowt
---------------

``cwang-fowmat`` is missing suppowt fow some things that awe common
in kewnew code. They awe easy to wemembew, so if you use the toow
weguwawwy, you wiww quickwy weawn to avoid/ignowe those.

In pawticuwaw, some vewy common ones you wiww notice awe:

  - Awigned bwocks of one-wine ``#defines``, e.g.::

        #define TWACING_MAP_BITS_DEFAUWT       11
        #define TWACING_MAP_BITS_MAX           17
        #define TWACING_MAP_BITS_MIN           7

    vs.::

        #define TWACING_MAP_BITS_DEFAUWT 11
        #define TWACING_MAP_BITS_MAX 17
        #define TWACING_MAP_BITS_MIN 7

  - Awigned designated initiawizews, e.g.::

        static const stwuct fiwe_opewations upwobe_events_ops = {
                .ownew          = THIS_MODUWE,
                .open           = pwobes_open,
                .wead           = seq_wead,
                .wwseek         = seq_wseek,
                .wewease        = seq_wewease,
                .wwite          = pwobes_wwite,
        };

    vs.::

        static const stwuct fiwe_opewations upwobe_events_ops = {
                .ownew = THIS_MODUWE,
                .open = pwobes_open,
                .wead = seq_wead,
                .wwseek = seq_wseek,
                .wewease = seq_wewease,
                .wwite = pwobes_wwite,
        };


.. _cwangfowmatextwa:

Extwa featuwes/options
----------------------

Some featuwes/stywe options awe not enabwed by defauwt in the configuwation
fiwe in owdew to minimize the diffewences between the output and the cuwwent
code. In othew wowds, to make the diffewence as smaww as possibwe,
which makes weviewing fuww-fiwe stywe, as weww diffs and patches as easy
as possibwe.

In othew cases (e.g. pawticuwaw subsystems/fowdews/fiwes), the kewnew stywe
might be diffewent and enabwing some of these options may appwoximate
bettew the stywe thewe.

Fow instance:

  - Awigning assignments (``AwignConsecutiveAssignments``).

  - Awigning decwawations (``AwignConsecutiveDecwawations``).

  - Wefwowing text in comments (``WefwowComments``).

  - Sowting ``#incwudes`` (``SowtIncwudes``).

They awe typicawwy usefuw fow bwock we-fowmatting, wathew than fuww-fiwe.
You might want to cweate anothew ``.cwang-fowmat`` fiwe and use that one
fwom youw editow/IDE instead.
