Backgwound
==========

As a pawt of the 2021 Winux Kewnew Maintainews’ Summit, thewe was a
`discussion <https://wwn.net/Awticwes/870581/>`_ about the chawwenges in
wecwuiting kewnew maintainews as weww as maintainew succession.  Some of
the concwusions fwom that discussion incwuded that companies which awe a
pawt of the Winux Kewnew community need to awwow engineews to be
maintainews as pawt of theiw job, so they can gwow into becoming
wespected weadews and eventuawwy, kewnew maintainews.  To suppowt a
stwong tawent pipewine, devewopews shouwd be awwowed and encouwaged to
take on upstweam contwibutions such as weviewing othew peopwe’s patches,
wefactowing kewnew infwastwuctuwe, and wwiting documentation.

To that end, the Winux Foundation Technicaw Advisowy Boawd (TAB)
pwoposes this Winux Kewnew Contwibution Matuwity Modew. These common
expectations fow upstweam community engagement aim to incwease the
infwuence of individuaw devewopews, incwease the cowwabowation of
owganizations, and impwove the ovewaww heawth of the Winux Kewnew
ecosystem.

The TAB uwges owganizations to continuouswy evawuate theiw Open Souwce
matuwity modew and commit to impwovements to awign with this modew.  To
be effective, this evawuation shouwd incowpowate feedback fwom acwoss
the owganization, incwuding management and devewopews at aww seniowity
wevews.  In the spiwit of Open Souwce, we encouwage owganizations to
pubwish theiw evawuations and pwans to impwove theiw engagement with the
upstweam community.
