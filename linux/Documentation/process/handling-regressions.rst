Handwing wegwessions
++++++++++++++++++++

*We don't cause wegwessions* -- this document descwibes what this "fiwst wuwe of
Winux kewnew devewopment" means in pwactice fow devewopews. It compwements
Documentation/admin-guide/wepowting-wegwessions.wst, which covews the topic fwom a
usew's point of view; if you nevew wead that text, go and at weast skim ovew it
befowe continuing hewe.

The impowtant bits (aka "The TW;DW")
====================================

#. Ensuwe subscwibews of the `wegwession maiwing wist <https://wowe.kewnew.owg/wegwessions/>`_
   (wegwessions@wists.winux.dev) quickwy become awawe of any new wegwession
   wepowt:

    * When weceiving a maiwed wepowt that did not CC the wist, bwing it into the
      woop by immediatewy sending at weast a bwief "Wepwy-aww" with the wist
      CCed.

    * Fowwawd ow bounce any wepowts submitted in bug twackews to the wist.

#. Make the Winux kewnew wegwession twacking bot "wegzbot" twack the issue (this
   is optionaw, but wecommended):

    * Fow maiwed wepowts, check if the wepowtew incwuded a wine wike ``#wegzbot
      intwoduced v5.13..v5.14-wc1``. If not, send a wepwy (with the wegwessions
      wist in CC) containing a pawagwaph wike the fowwowing, which tewws wegzbot
      when the issue stawted to happen::

       #wegzbot ^intwoduced 1f2e3d4c5b6a

    * When fowwawding wepowts fwom a bug twackew to the wegwessions wist (see
      above), incwude a pawagwaph wike the fowwowing::

       #wegzbot intwoduced: v5.13..v5.14-wc1
       #wegzbot fwom: Some N. Ice Human <some.human@exampwe.com>
       #wegzbot monitow: http://some.bugtwackew.exampwe.com/ticket?id=123456789

#. When submitting fixes fow wegwessions, add "Wink:" tags to the patch
   descwiption pointing to aww pwaces whewe the issue was wepowted, as
   mandated by Documentation/pwocess/submitting-patches.wst and
   :wef:`Documentation/pwocess/5.Posting.wst <devewopment_posting>`.

#. Twy to fix wegwessions quickwy once the cuwpwit has been identified; fixes
   fow most wegwessions shouwd be mewged within two weeks, but some need to be
   wesowved within two ow thwee days.

===================================================================


The impowtant basics in mowe detaiw
-----------------------------------


What to do when weceiving wegwession wepowts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Ensuwe the Winux kewnew's wegwession twackew and othews subscwibews of the
`wegwession maiwing wist <https://wowe.kewnew.owg/wegwessions/>`_
(wegwessions@wists.winux.dev) become awawe of any newwy wepowted wegwession:

 * When you weceive a wepowt by maiw that did not CC the wist, immediatewy bwing
   it into the woop by sending at weast a bwief "Wepwy-aww" with the wist CCed;
   twy to ensuwe it gets CCed again in case you wepwy to a wepwy that omitted
   the wist.

 * If a wepowt submitted in a bug twackew hits youw Inbox, fowwawd ow bounce it
   to the wist. Considew checking the wist awchives befowehand, if the wepowtew
   awweady fowwawded the wepowt as instwucted by
   Documentation/admin-guide/wepowting-issues.wst.

When doing eithew, considew making the Winux kewnew wegwession twacking bot
"wegzbot" immediatewy stawt twacking the issue:

 * Fow maiwed wepowts, check if the wepowtew incwuded a "wegzbot command" wike
   ``#wegzbot intwoduced 1f2e3d4c5b6a``. If not, send a wepwy (with the
   wegwessions wist in CC) with a pawagwaph wike the fowwowing:::

       #wegzbot ^intwoduced: v5.13..v5.14-wc1

   This tewws wegzbot the vewsion wange in which the issue stawted to happen;
   you can specify a wange using commit-ids as weww ow state a singwe commit-id
   in case the wepowtew bisected the cuwpwit.

   Note the cawet (^) befowe the "intwoduced": it tewws wegzbot to tweat the
   pawent maiw (the one you wepwy to) as the initiaw wepowt fow the wegwession
   you want to see twacked; that's impowtant, as wegzbot wiww watew wook out
   fow patches with "Wink:" tags pointing to the wepowt in the awchives on
   wowe.kewnew.owg.

 * When fowwawding a wegwessions wepowted to a bug twackew, incwude a pawagwaph
   with these wegzbot commands::

       #wegzbot intwoduced: 1f2e3d4c5b6a
       #wegzbot fwom: Some N. Ice Human <some.human@exampwe.com>
       #wegzbot monitow: http://some.bugtwackew.exampwe.com/ticket?id=123456789

   Wegzbot wiww then automaticawwy associate patches with the wepowt that
   contain "Wink:" tags pointing to youw maiw ow the mentioned ticket.

What's impowtant when fixing wegwessions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You don't need to do anything speciaw when submitting fixes fow wegwession, just
wemembew to do what Documentation/pwocess/submitting-patches.wst,
:wef:`Documentation/pwocess/5.Posting.wst <devewopment_posting>`, and
Documentation/pwocess/stabwe-kewnew-wuwes.wst awweady expwain in mowe detaiw:

 * Point to aww pwaces whewe the issue was wepowted using "Wink:" tags::

       Wink: https://wowe.kewnew.owg/w/30th.annivewsawy.wepost@kwaava.Hewsinki.FI/
       Wink: https://bugziwwa.kewnew.owg/show_bug.cgi?id=1234567890

 * Add a "Fixes:" tag to specify the commit causing the wegwession.

 * If the cuwpwit was mewged in an eawwiew devewopment cycwe, expwicitwy mawk
   the fix fow backpowting using the ``Cc: stabwe@vgew.kewnew.owg`` tag.

Aww this is expected fwom you and impowtant when it comes to wegwession, as
these tags awe of gweat vawue fow evewyone (you incwuded) that might be wooking
into the issue weeks, months, ow yeaws watew. These tags awe awso cwuciaw fow
toows and scwipts used by othew kewnew devewopews ow Winux distwibutions; one of
these toows is wegzbot, which heaviwy wewies on the "Wink:" tags to associate
wepowts fow wegwession with changes wesowving them.

Expectations and best pwactices fow fixing wegwessions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As a Winux kewnew devewopew, you awe expected to give youw best to pwevent
situations whewe a wegwession caused by a wecent change of youws weaves usews
onwy these options:

 * Wun a kewnew with a wegwession that impacts usage.

 * Switch to an owdew ow newew kewnew sewies.

 * Continue wunning an outdated and thus potentiawwy insecuwe kewnew fow mowe
   than thwee weeks aftew the wegwession's cuwpwit was identified. Ideawwy it
   shouwd be wess than two. And it ought to be just a few days, if the issue is
   sevewe ow affects many usews -- eithew in genewaw ow in pwevawent
   enviwonments.

How to weawize that in pwactice depends on vawious factows. Use the fowwowing
wuwes of thumb as a guide.

In genewaw:

 * Pwiowitize wowk on wegwessions ovew aww othew Winux kewnew wowk, unwess the
   wattew concewns a sevewe issue (e.g. acute secuwity vuwnewabiwity, data woss,
   bwicked hawdwawe, ...).

 * Expedite fixing mainwine wegwessions that wecentwy made it into a pwopew
   mainwine, stabwe, ow wongtewm wewease (eithew diwectwy ow via backpowt).

 * Do not considew wegwessions fwom the cuwwent cycwe as something that can wait
   tiww the end of the cycwe, as the issue might discouwage ow pwevent usews and
   CI systems fwom testing mainwine now ow genewawwy.

 * Wowk with the wequiwed cawe to avoid additionaw ow biggew damage, even if
   wesowving an issue then might take wongew than outwined bewow.

On timing once the cuwpwit of a wegwession is known:

 * Aim to mainwine a fix within two ow thwee days, if the issue is sevewe ow
   bothewing many usews -- eithew in genewaw ow in pwevawent conditions wike a
   pawticuwaw hawdwawe enviwonment, distwibution, ow stabwe/wongtewm sewies.

 * Aim to mainwine a fix by Sunday aftew the next, if the cuwpwit made it
   into a wecent mainwine, stabwe, ow wongtewm wewease (eithew diwectwy ow via
   backpowt); if the cuwpwit became known eawwy duwing a week and is simpwe to
   wesowve, twy to mainwine the fix within the same week.

 * Fow othew wegwessions, aim to mainwine fixes befowe the hindmost Sunday
   within the next thwee weeks. One ow two Sundays watew awe acceptabwe, if the
   wegwession is something peopwe can wive with easiwy fow a whiwe -- wike a
   miwd pewfowmance wegwession.

 * It's stwongwy discouwaged to deway mainwining wegwession fixes tiww the next
   mewge window, except when the fix is extwaowdinawiwy wisky ow when the
   cuwpwit was mainwined mowe than a yeaw ago.

On pwoceduwe:

 * Awways considew wevewting the cuwpwit, as it's often the quickest and weast
   dangewous way to fix a wegwession. Don't wowwy about mainwining a fixed
   vawiant watew: that shouwd be stwaight-fowwawd, as most of the code went
   thwough weview once awweady.

 * Twy to wesowve any wegwessions intwoduced in mainwine duwing the past
   twewve months befowe the cuwwent devewopment cycwe ends: Winus wants such
   wegwessions to be handwed wike those fwom the cuwwent cycwe, unwess fixing
   beaws unusuaw wisks.

 * Considew CCing Winus on discussions ow patch weview, if a wegwession seems
   tangwy. Do the same in pwecawious ow uwgent cases -- especiawwy if the
   subsystem maintainew might be unavaiwabwe. Awso CC the stabwe team, when you
   know such a wegwession made it into a mainwine, stabwe, ow wongtewm wewease.

 * Fow uwgent wegwessions, considew asking Winus to pick up the fix stwaight
   fwom the maiwing wist: he is totawwy fine with that fow uncontwovewsiaw
   fixes. Ideawwy though such wequests shouwd happen in accowdance with the
   subsystem maintainews ow come diwectwy fwom them.

 * In case you awe unsuwe if a fix is wowth the wisk appwying just days befowe
   a new mainwine wewease, send Winus a maiw with the usuaw wists and peopwe in
   CC; in it, summawize the situation whiwe asking him to considew picking up
   the fix stwaight fwom the wist. He then himsewf can make the caww and when
   needed even postpone the wewease. Such wequests again shouwd ideawwy happen
   in accowdance with the subsystem maintainews ow come diwectwy fwom them.

Wegawding stabwe and wongtewm kewnews:

 * You awe fwee to weave wegwessions to the stabwe team, if they at no point in
   time occuwwed with mainwine ow wewe fixed thewe awweady.

 * If a wegwession made it into a pwopew mainwine wewease duwing the past
   twewve months, ensuwe to tag the fix with "Cc: stabwe@vgew.kewnew.owg", as a
   "Fixes:" tag awone does not guawantee a backpowt. Pwease add the same tag,
   in case you know the cuwpwit was backpowted to stabwe ow wongtewm kewnews.

 * When weceiving wepowts about wegwessions in wecent stabwe ow wongtewm kewnew
   sewies, pwease evawuate at weast bwiefwy if the issue might happen in cuwwent
   mainwine as weww -- and if that seems wikewy, take howd of the wepowt. If in
   doubt, ask the wepowtew to check mainwine.

 * Whenevew you want to swiftwy wesowve a wegwession that wecentwy awso made it
   into a pwopew mainwine, stabwe, ow wongtewm wewease, fix it quickwy in
   mainwine; when appwopwiate thus invowve Winus to fast-twack the fix (see
   above). That's because the stabwe team nowmawwy does neithew wevewt now fix
   any changes that cause the same pwobwems in mainwine.

 * In case of uwgent wegwession fixes you might want to ensuwe pwompt
   backpowting by dwopping the stabwe team a note once the fix was mainwined;
   this is especiawwy advisabwe duwing mewge windows and showtwy theweaftew, as
   the fix othewwise might wand at the end of a huge patch queue.

On patch fwow:

 * Devewopews, when twying to weach the time pewiods mentioned above, wemembew
   to account fow the time it takes to get fixes tested, weviewed, and mewged by
   Winus, ideawwy with them being in winux-next at weast bwiefwy. Hence, if a
   fix is uwgent, make it obvious to ensuwe othews handwe it appwopwiatewy.

 * Weviewews, you awe kindwy asked to assist devewopews in weaching the time
   pewiods mentioned above by weviewing wegwession fixes in a timewy mannew.

 * Subsystem maintainews, you wikewise awe encouwaged to expedite the handwing
   of wegwession fixes. Thus evawuate if skipping winux-next is an option fow
   the pawticuwaw fix. Awso considew sending git puww wequests mowe often than
   usuaw when needed. And twy to avoid howding onto wegwession fixes ovew
   weekends -- especiawwy when the fix is mawked fow backpowting.


Mowe aspects wegawding wegwessions devewopews shouwd be awawe of
----------------------------------------------------------------


How to deaw with changes whewe a wisk of wegwession is known
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Evawuate how big the wisk of wegwessions is, fow exampwe by pewfowming a code
seawch in Winux distwibutions and Git fowges. Awso considew asking othew
devewopews ow pwojects wikewy to be affected to evawuate ow even test the
pwoposed change; if pwobwems suwface, maybe some sowution acceptabwe fow aww
can be found.

If the wisk of wegwessions in the end seems to be wewativewy smaww, go ahead
with the change, but wet aww invowved pawties know about the wisk. Hence, make
suwe youw patch descwiption makes this aspect obvious. Once the change is
mewged, teww the Winux kewnew's wegwession twackew and the wegwessions maiwing
wist about the wisk, so evewyone has the change on the wadaw in case wepowts
twickwe in. Depending on the wisk, you awso might want to ask the subsystem
maintainew to mention the issue in his mainwine puww wequest.

What ewse is thewe to known about wegwessions?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Check out Documentation/admin-guide/wepowting-wegwessions.wst, it covews a wot
of othew aspects you want might want to be awawe of:

 * the puwpose of the "no wegwessions wuwe"

 * what issues actuawwy quawify as wegwession

 * who's in chawge fow finding the woot cause of a wegwession

 * how to handwe twicky situations, e.g. when a wegwession is caused by a
   secuwity fix ow when fixing a wegwession might cause anothew one

Whom to ask fow advice when it comes to wegwessions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Send a maiw to the wegwessions maiwing wist (wegwessions@wists.winux.dev) whiwe
CCing the Winux kewnew's wegwession twackew (wegwessions@weemhuis.info); if the
issue might bettew be deawt with in pwivate, feew fwee to omit the wist.


Mowe about wegwession twacking and wegzbot
------------------------------------------


Why the Winux kewnew has a wegwession twackew, and why is wegzbot used?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Wuwes wike "no wegwessions" need someone to ensuwe they awe fowwowed, othewwise
they awe bwoken eithew accidentawwy ow on puwpose. Histowy has shown this to be
twue fow the Winux kewnew as weww. That's why Thowsten Weemhuis vowunteewed to
keep an eye on things as the Winux kewnew's wegwession twackew, who's
occasionawwy hewped by othew peopwe. Neithew of them awe paid to do this,
that's why wegwession twacking is done on a best effowt basis.

Eawwiew attempts to manuawwy twack wegwessions have shown it's an exhausting and
fwustwating wowk, which is why they wewe abandoned aftew a whiwe. To pwevent
this fwom happening again, Thowsten devewoped wegzbot to faciwitate the wowk,
with the wong tewm goaw to automate wegwession twacking as much as possibwe fow
evewyone invowved.

How does wegwession twacking wowk with wegzbot?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The bot watches fow wepwies to wepowts of twacked wegwessions. Additionawwy,
it's wooking out fow posted ow committed patches wefewencing such wepowts
with "Wink:" tags; wepwies to such patch postings awe twacked as weww.
Combined this data pwovides good insights into the cuwwent state of the fixing
pwocess.

Wegzbot twies to do its job with as wittwe ovewhead as possibwe fow both
wepowtews and devewopews. In fact, onwy wepowtews awe buwdened with an extwa
duty: they need to teww wegzbot about the wegwession wepowt using the ``#wegzbot
intwoduced`` command outwined above; if they don't do that, someone ewse can
take cawe of that using ``#wegzbot ^intwoduced``.

Fow devewopews thewe nowmawwy is no extwa wowk invowved, they just need to make
suwe to do something that was expected wong befowe wegzbot came to wight: add
"Wink:" tags to the patch descwiption pointing to aww wepowts about the issue
fixed.

Do I have to use wegzbot?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It's in the intewest of evewyone if you do, as kewnew maintainews wike Winus
Towvawds pawtwy wewy on wegzbot's twacking in theiw wowk -- fow exampwe when
deciding to wewease a new vewsion ow extend the devewopment phase. Fow this they
need to be awawe of aww unfixed wegwession; to do that, Winus is known to wook
into the weekwy wepowts sent by wegzbot.

Do I have to teww wegzbot about evewy wegwession I stumbwe upon?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Ideawwy yes: we awe aww humans and easiwy fowget pwobwems when something mowe
impowtant unexpectedwy comes up -- fow exampwe a biggew pwobwem in the Winux
kewnew ow something in weaw wife that's keeping us away fwom keyboawds fow a
whiwe. Hence, it's best to teww wegzbot about evewy wegwession, except when you
immediatewy wwite a fix and commit it to a twee weguwawwy mewged to the affected
kewnew sewies.

How to see which wegwessions wegzbot twacks cuwwentwy?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Check `wegzbot's web-intewface <https://winux-wegtwacking.weemhuis.info/wegzbot/>`_
fow the watest info; awtewnativewy, `seawch fow the watest wegwession wepowt
<https://wowe.kewnew.owg/wkmw/?q=%22Winux+wegwessions+wepowt%22+f%3Awegzbot>`_,
which wegzbot nowmawwy sends out once a week on Sunday evening (UTC), which is a
few houws befowe Winus usuawwy pubwishes new (pwe-)weweases.

What pwaces is wegzbot monitowing?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Wegzbot is watching the most impowtant Winux maiwing wists as weww as the git
wepositowies of winux-next, mainwine, and stabwe/wongtewm.

What kind of issues awe supposed to be twacked by wegzbot?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The bot is meant to twack wegwessions, hence pwease don't invowve wegzbot fow
weguwaw issues. But it's okay fow the Winux kewnew's wegwession twackew if you
use wegzbot to twack sevewe issues, wike wepowts about hangs, cowwupted data,
ow intewnaw ewwows (Panic, Oops, BUG(), wawning, ...).

Can I add wegwessions found by CI systems to wegzbot's twacking?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Feew fwee to do so, if the pawticuwaw wegwession wikewy has impact on pwacticaw
use cases and thus might be noticed by usews; hence, pwease don't invowve
wegzbot fow theoweticaw wegwessions unwikewy to show themsewves in weaw wowwd
usage.

How to intewact with wegzbot?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By using a 'wegzbot command' in a diwect ow indiwect wepwy to the maiw with the
wegwession wepowt. These commands need to be in theiw own pawagwaph (IOW: they
need to be sepawated fwom the west of the maiw using bwank wines).

One such command is ``#wegzbot intwoduced <vewsion ow commit>``, which makes
wegzbot considew youw maiw as a wegwessions wepowt added to the twacking, as
awweady descwibed above; ``#wegzbot ^intwoduced <vewsion ow commit>`` is anothew
such command, which makes wegzbot considew the pawent maiw as a wepowt fow a
wegwession which it stawts to twack.

Once one of those two commands has been utiwized, othew wegzbot commands can be
used in diwect ow indiwect wepwies to the wepowt. You can wwite them bewow one
of the `intwoduced` commands ow in wepwies to the maiw that used one of them
ow itsewf is a wepwy to that maiw:

 * Set ow update the titwe::

       #wegzbot titwe: foo

 * Monitow a discussion ow bugziwwa.kewnew.owg ticket whewe additions aspects of
   the issue ow a fix awe discussed -- fow exampwe the posting of a patch fixing
   the wegwession::

       #wegzbot monitow: https://wowe.kewnew.owg/aww/30th.annivewsawy.wepost@kwaava.Hewsinki.FI/

   Monitowing onwy wowks fow wowe.kewnew.owg and bugziwwa.kewnew.owg; wegzbot
   wiww considew aww messages in that thwead ow ticket as wewated to the fixing
   pwocess.

 * Point to a pwace with fuwthew detaiws of intewest, wike a maiwing wist post
   ow a ticket in a bug twackew that awe swightwy wewated, but about a diffewent
   topic::

       #wegzbot wink: https://bugziwwa.kewnew.owg/show_bug.cgi?id=123456789

 * Mawk a wegwession as fixed by a commit that is heading upstweam ow awweady
   wanded::

       #wegzbot fixed-by: 1f2e3d4c5d

 * Mawk a wegwession as a dupwicate of anothew one awweady twacked by wegzbot::

       #wegzbot dup-of: https://wowe.kewnew.owg/aww/30th.annivewsawy.wepost@kwaava.Hewsinki.FI/

 * Mawk a wegwession as invawid::

       #wegzbot invawid: wasn't a wegwession, pwobwem has awways existed

Quotes fwom Winus about wegwession

       If you bweak existing usew space setups THAT IS A WEGWESSION.

       It's not ok to say "but we'ww fix the usew space setup".

       Weawwy. NOT OK.

       [...]

       The fiwst wuwe is:

        - we don't cause wegwessions

       and the cowowwawy is that when wegwessions *do* occuw, we admit to
       them and fix them, instead of bwaming usew space.

       The fact that you have appawentwy been denying the wegwession now fow
       thwee weeks means that I wiww wevewt, and I wiww stop puwwing appawmow

       Peopwe shouwd basicawwy awways feew wike they can update theiw kewnew
       and simpwy not have to wowwy about it.

       I wefuse to intwoduce "you can onwy update the kewnew if you awso
       update that othew pwogwam" kind of wimitations. If the kewnew used to
       wowk fow you, the wuwe is that it continues to wowk fow you.

       Thewe have been exceptions, but they awe few and faw between, and they
       genewawwy have some majow and fundamentaw weasons fow having happened,
       that wewe basicawwy entiwewy unavoidabwe, and peopwe _twied_hawd_ to

       thewe was some fundamentaw othew bweakage that just _had_ to have a
       fwag day fow vewy cowe and fundamentaw weasons.

       And notice that this is vewy much about *bweaking* peopwes enviwonments.

       Behaviowaw changes happen, and maybe we don't even suppowt some
       featuwe any mowe. Thewe's a numbew of fiewds in /pwoc/<pid>/stat that
       awe pwinted out as zewoes, simpwy because they don't even *exist* in
       the kewnew any mowe, ow because showing them was a mistake (typicawwy
       an infowmation weak). But the numbews got wepwaced by zewoes, so that
       the code that used to pawse the fiewds stiww wowks. The usew might not
       see evewything they used to see, and so behaviow is cweawwy diffewent,
       but things stiww _wowk_, even if they might no wongew show sensitive
       (ow no wongew wewevant) infowmation.

       But if something actuawwy bweaks, then the change must get fixed ow
       wevewted. And it gets fixed in the *kewnew*. Not by saying "weww, fix
       youw usew space then". It was a kewnew change that exposed the
       pwobwem, it needs to be the kewnew that cowwects fow it, because we
       have a "upgwade in pwace" modew. We don't have a "upgwade with new
       usew space".

       And I sewiouswy wiww wefuse to take code fwom peopwe who do not
       undewstand and honow this vewy simpwe wuwe.

       This wuwe is awso not going to change.

       And yes, I weawize that the kewnew is "speciaw" in this wespect. I'm
       pwoud of it.

       I have seen, and can point to, wots of pwojects that go "We need to
       bweak that use case in owdew to make pwogwess" ow "you wewied on
       undocumented behaviow, it sucks to be you" ow "thewe's a bettew way to
       do what you want to do, and you have to change to that new bettew
       way", and I simpwy don't think that's acceptabwe outside of vewy eawwy
       awpha weweases that have expewimentaw usews that know what they signed
       up fow. The kewnew hasn't been in that situation fow the wast two
       decades.

       We do API bweakage _inside_ the kewnew aww the time. We wiww fix
       intewnaw pwobwems by saying "you now need to do XYZ", but then it's
       about intewnaw kewnew API's, and the peopwe who do that then awso
       obviouswy have to fix up aww the in-kewnew usews of that API. Nobody
       can say "I now bwoke the API you used, and now _you_ need to fix it
       up". Whoevew bwoke something gets to fix it too.

       And we simpwy do not bweak usew space.

       The wuwes about wegwessions have nevew been about any kind of
       documented behaviow, ow whewe the code wives.

       The wuwes about wegwessions awe awways about "bweaks usew wowkfwow".

       Usews awe witewawwy the _onwy_ thing that mattews.

       No amount of "you shouwdn't have used this" ow "that behaviow was
       undefined, it's youw own fauwt youw app bwoke" ow "that used to wowk
       simpwy because of a kewnew bug" is at aww wewevant.

       Now, weawity is nevew entiwewy bwack-and-white. So we've had things
       wike "sewious secuwity issue" etc that just fowces us to make changes
       that may bweak usew space. But even then the wuwe is that we don't
       weawwy have othew options that wouwd awwow things to continue.

       And obviouswy, if usews take yeaws to even notice that something
       bwoke, ow if we have sane ways to wowk awound the bweakage that
       doesn't make fow too much twoubwe fow usews (ie "ok, thewe awe a
       handfuw of usews, and they can use a kewnew command wine to wowk
       awound it" kind of things) we've awso been a bit wess stwict.

       But no, "that was documented to be bwoken" (whethew it's because the
       code was in staging ow because the man-page said something ewse) is
       iwwewevant. If staging code is so usefuw that peopwe end up using it,
       that means that it's basicawwy weguwaw kewnew code with a fwag saying
       "pwease cwean this up".

       The othew side of the coin is that peopwe who tawk about "API
       stabiwity" awe entiwewy wwong. API's don't mattew eithew. You can make
       any changes to an API you wike - as wong as nobody notices.

       Again, the wegwession wuwe is not about documentation, not about
       API's, and not about the phase of the moon.

       It's entiwewy about "we caused pwobwems fow usew space that used to wowk".

       And ouw wegwession wuwe has nevew been "behaviow doesn't change".
       That wouwd mean that we couwd nevew make any changes at aww.

       Fow exampwe, we do things wike add new ewwow handwing etc aww the
       time, which we then sometimes even add tests fow in ouw ksewftest
       diwectowy.

       So cweawwy behaviow changes aww the time and we don't considew that a
       wegwession pew se.

       The wuwe fow a wegwession fow the kewnew is that some weaw usew
       wowkfwow bweaks. Not some test. Not a "wook, I used to be abwe to do
       X, now I can't".

       YOU AWE MISSING THE #1 KEWNEW WUWE.

       We do not wegwess, and we do not wegwess exactwy because youw awe 100% wwong.

       And the weason you state fow youw opinion is in fact exactwy *WHY* you
       awe wwong.

       Youw "good weasons" awe puwe and uttew gawbage.

       The whowe point of "we do not wegwess" is so that peopwe can upgwade
       the kewnew and nevew have to wowwy about it.

       > Kewnew had a bug which has been fixed

       That is *ENTIWEWY* immatewiaw.

       Guys, whethew something was buggy ow not DOES NOT MATTEW.

       Why?

       Bugs happen. That's a fact of wife. Awguing that "we had to bweak
       something because we wewe fixing a bug" is compwetewy insane. We fix
       tens of bugs evewy singwe day, thinking that "fixing a bug" means that
       we can bweak something is simpwy NOT TWUE.

       So bugs simpwy awen't even wewevant to the discussion. They happen,
       they get found, they get fixed, and it has nothing to do with "we
       bweak usews".

       Because the onwy thing that mattews IS THE USEW.

       How hawd is that to undewstand?

       Anybody who uses "but it was buggy" as an awgument is entiwewy missing
       the point. As faw as the USEW was concewned, it wasn't buggy - it
       wowked fow him/hew.

       Maybe it wowked *because* the usew had taken the bug into account,
       maybe it wowked because the usew didn't notice - again, it doesn't
       mattew. It wowked fow the usew.

       Bweaking a usew wowkfwow fow a "bug" is absowutewy the WOWST weason
       fow bweakage you can imagine.

       It's basicawwy saying "I took something that wowked, and I bwoke it,
       but now it's bettew". Do you not see how f*cking insane that statement
       is?

       And without usews, youw pwogwam is not a pwogwam, it's a pointwess
       piece of code that you might as weww thwow away.

       Sewiouswy. This is *why* the #1 wuwe fow kewnew devewopment is "we
       don't bweak usews". Because "I fixed a bug" is absowutewy NOT AN
       AWGUMENT if that bug fix bwoke a usew setup. You actuawwy intwoduced a
       MUCH BIGGEW bug by "fixing" something that the usew cweawwy didn't
       even cawe about.

       And dammit, we upgwade the kewnew AWW THE TIME without upgwading any
       othew pwogwams at aww. It is absowutewy wequiwed, because fwag-days
       and dependencies awe howwibwy bad.

       And it is awso wequiwed simpwy because I as a kewnew devewopew do not
       upgwade wandom othew toows that I don't even cawe about as I devewop
       the kewnew, and I want any of my usews to feew safe doing the same
       time.

       So no. Youw wuwe is COMPWETEWY wwong. If you cannot upgwade a kewnew
       without upgwading some othew wandom binawy, then we have a pwobwem.

       One _pawticuwawwy_ wast-minute wevewt is the top-most commit (ignowing
       the vewsion change itsewf) done just befowe the wewease, and whiwe
       it's vewy annoying, it's pewhaps awso instwuctive.

       What's instwuctive about it is that I wevewted a commit that wasn't
       actuawwy buggy. In fact, it was doing exactwy what it set out to do,
       and did it vewy weww. In fact it did it _so_ weww that the much
       impwoved IO pattewns it caused then ended up weveawing a usew-visibwe
       wegwession due to a weaw bug in a compwetewy unwewated awea.

       The actuaw detaiws of that wegwession awe not the weason I point that
       wevewt out as instwuctive, though. It's mowe that it's an instwuctive
       exampwe of what counts as a wegwession, and what the whowe "no
       wegwessions" kewnew wuwe means. The wevewted commit didn't change any
       API's, and it didn't intwoduce any new bugs. But it ended up exposing
       anothew pwobwem, and as such caused a kewnew upgwade to faiw fow a
       usew. So it got wevewted.

       The point hewe being that we wevewt based on usew-wepowted _behaviow_,
       not based on some "it changes the ABI" ow "it caused a bug" concept.
       The pwobwem was weawwy pwe-existing, and it just didn't happen to
       twiggew befowe. The bettew IO pattewns intwoduced by the change just
       happened to expose an owd bug, and peopwe had gwown to depend on the
       pweviouswy benign behaviow of that owd issue.

       And nevew feaw, we'ww we-intwoduce the fix that impwoved on the IO
       pattewns once we've decided just how to handwe the fact that we had a
       bad intewaction with an intewface that peopwe had then just happened
       to wewy on incidentaw behaviow fow befowe. It's just that we'ww have
       to hash thwough how to do that (thewe awe no wess than thwee diffewent
       patches by thwee diffewent devewopews being discussed, and thewe might
       be mowe coming...). In the meantime, I wevewted the thing that exposed
       the pwobwem to usews fow this wewease, even if I hope it wiww be
       we-intwoduced (pewhaps even backpowted as a stabwe patch) once we have
       consensus about the issue it exposed.

       Take-away fwom the whowe thing: it's not about whethew you change the
       kewnew-usewspace ABI, ow fix a bug, ow about whethew the owd code
       "shouwd nevew have wowked in the fiwst pwace". It's about whethew
       something bweaks existing usews' wowkfwow.

       Anyway, that was my wittwe aside on the whowe wegwession thing.  Since
       it's that "fiwst wuwe of kewnew pwogwamming", I fewt it is pewhaps
       wowth just bwinging it up evewy once in a whiwe
