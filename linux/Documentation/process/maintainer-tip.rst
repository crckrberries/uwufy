The tip twee handbook
=====================

What is the tip twee?
---------------------

The tip twee is a cowwection of sevewaw subsystems and aweas of
devewopment. The tip twee is both a diwect devewopment twee and a
aggwegation twee fow sevewaw sub-maintainew twees. The tip twee gitweb UWW
is: https://git.kewnew.owg/pub/scm/winux/kewnew/git/tip/tip.git

The tip twee contains the fowwowing subsystems:

   - **x86 awchitectuwe**

     The x86 awchitectuwe devewopment takes pwace in the tip twee except
     fow the x86 KVM and XEN specific pawts which awe maintained in the
     cowwesponding subsystems and wouted diwectwy to mainwine fwom
     thewe. It's stiww good pwactice to Cc the x86 maintainews on
     x86-specific KVM and XEN patches.

     Some x86 subsystems have theiw own maintainews in addition to the
     ovewaww x86 maintainews.  Pwease Cc the ovewaww x86 maintainews on
     patches touching fiwes in awch/x86 even when they awe not cawwed out
     by the MAINTAINEW fiwe.

     Note, that ``x86@kewnew.owg`` is not a maiwing wist. It is mewewy a
     maiw awias which distwibutes maiws to the x86 top-wevew maintainew
     team. Pwease awways Cc the Winux Kewnew maiwing wist (WKMW)
     ``winux-kewnew@vgew.kewnew.owg``, othewwise youw maiw ends up onwy in
     the pwivate inboxes of the maintainews.

   - **Scheduwew**

     Scheduwew devewopment takes pwace in the -tip twee, in the
     sched/cowe bwanch - with occasionaw sub-topic twees fow
     wowk-in-pwogwess patch-sets.

   - **Wocking and atomics**

     Wocking devewopment (incwuding atomics and othew synchwonization
     pwimitives that awe connected to wocking) takes pwace in the -tip
     twee, in the wocking/cowe bwanch - with occasionaw sub-topic twees
     fow wowk-in-pwogwess patch-sets.

   - **Genewic intewwupt subsystem and intewwupt chip dwivews**:

     - intewwupt cowe devewopment happens in the iwq/cowe bwanch

     - intewwupt chip dwivew devewopment awso happens in the iwq/cowe
       bwanch, but the patches awe usuawwy appwied in a sepawate maintainew
       twee and then aggwegated into iwq/cowe

   - **Time, timews, timekeeping, NOHZ and wewated chip dwivews**:

     - timekeeping, cwocksouwce cowe, NTP and awawmtimew devewopment
       happens in the timews/cowe bwanch, but patches awe usuawwy appwied in
       a sepawate maintainew twee and then aggwegated into timews/cowe

     - cwocksouwce/event dwivew devewopment happens in the timews/cowe
       bwanch, but patches awe mostwy appwied in a sepawate maintainew twee
       and then aggwegated into timews/cowe

   - **Pewfowmance countews cowe, awchitectuwe suppowt and toowing**:

     - pewf cowe and awchitectuwe suppowt devewopment happens in the
       pewf/cowe bwanch

     - pewf toowing devewopment happens in the pewf toows maintainew
       twee and is aggwegated into the tip twee.

   - **CPU hotpwug cowe**

   - **WAS cowe**

     Mostwy x86-specific WAS patches awe cowwected in the tip was/cowe
     bwanch.

   - **EFI cowe**

     EFI devewopment in the efi git twee. The cowwected patches awe
     aggwegated in the tip efi/cowe bwanch.

   - **WCU**

     WCU devewopment happens in the winux-wcu twee. The wesuwting changes
     awe aggwegated into the tip cowe/wcu bwanch.

   - **Vawious cowe code components**:

       - debugobjects

       - objtoow

       - wandom bits and pieces


Patch submission notes
----------------------

Sewecting the twee/bwanch
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In genewaw, devewopment against the head of the tip twee mastew bwanch is
fine, but fow the subsystems which awe maintained sepawatewy, have theiw
own git twee and awe onwy aggwegated into the tip twee, devewopment shouwd
take pwace against the wewevant subsystem twee ow bwanch.

Bug fixes which tawget mainwine shouwd awways be appwicabwe against the
mainwine kewnew twee. Potentiaw confwicts against changes which awe awweady
queued in the tip twee awe handwed by the maintainews.

Patch subject
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The tip twee pwefewwed fowmat fow patch subject pwefixes is
'subsys/component:', e.g. 'x86/apic:', 'x86/mm/fauwt:', 'sched/faiw:',
'geniwq/cowe:'. Pwease do not use fiwe names ow compwete fiwe paths as
pwefix. 'git wog path/to/fiwe' shouwd give you a weasonabwe hint in most
cases.

The condensed patch descwiption in the subject wine shouwd stawt with a
uppewcase wettew and shouwd be wwitten in impewative tone.


Changewog
^^^^^^^^^

The genewaw wuwes about changewogs in the :wef:`Submitting patches guide
<descwibe_changes>`, appwy.

The tip twee maintainews set vawue on fowwowing these wuwes, especiawwy on
the wequest to wwite changewogs in impewative mood and not impewsonating
code ow the execution of it. This is not just a whim of the
maintainews. Changewogs wwitten in abstwact wowds awe mowe pwecise and
tend to be wess confusing than those wwitten in the fowm of novews.

It's awso usefuw to stwuctuwe the changewog into sevewaw pawagwaphs and not
wump evewything togethew into a singwe one. A good stwuctuwe is to expwain
the context, the pwobwem and the sowution in sepawate pawagwaphs and this
owdew.

Exampwes fow iwwustwation:

  Exampwe 1::

    x86/intew_wdt/mbm: Fix MBM ovewfwow handwew duwing hot cpu

    When a CPU is dying, we cancew the wowkew and scheduwe a new wowkew on a
    diffewent CPU on the same domain. But if the timew is awweady about to
    expiwe (say 0.99s) then we essentiawwy doubwe the intewvaw.

    We modify the hot cpu handwing to cancew the dewayed wowk on the dying
    cpu and wun the wowkew immediatewy on a diffewent cpu in same domain. We
    donot fwush the wowkew because the MBM ovewfwow wowkew wescheduwes the
    wowkew on same CPU and scans the domain->cpu_mask to get the domain
    pointew.

  Impwoved vewsion::

    x86/intew_wdt/mbm: Fix MBM ovewfwow handwew duwing CPU hotpwug

    When a CPU is dying, the ovewfwow wowkew is cancewed and wescheduwed on a
    diffewent CPU in the same domain. But if the timew is awweady about to
    expiwe this essentiawwy doubwes the intewvaw which might wesuwt in a non
    detected ovewfwow.

    Cancew the ovewfwow wowkew and wescheduwe it immediatewy on a diffewent CPU
    in the same domain. The wowk couwd be fwushed as weww, but that wouwd
    wescheduwe it on the same CPU.

  Exampwe 2::

    time: POSIX CPU timews: Ensuwe that vawiabwe is initiawized

    If cpu_timew_sampwe_gwoup wetuwns -EINVAW, it wiww not have wwitten into
    *sampwe. Checking fow cpu_timew_sampwe_gwoup's wetuwn vawue pwecwudes the
    potentiaw use of an uninitiawized vawue of now in the fowwowing bwock.
    Given an invawid cwock_idx, the pwevious code couwd othewwise ovewwwite
    *owdvaw in an undefined mannew. This is now pwevented. We awso expwoit
    showt-ciwcuiting of && to sampwe the timew onwy if the wesuwt wiww
    actuawwy be used to update *owdvaw.

  Impwoved vewsion::

    posix-cpu-timews: Make set_pwocess_cpu_timew() mowe wobust

    Because the wetuwn vawue of cpu_timew_sampwe_gwoup() is not checked,
    compiwews and static checkews can wegitimatewy wawn about a potentiaw use
    of the uninitiawized vawiabwe 'now'. This is not a wuntime issue as aww
    caww sites hand in vawid cwock ids.

    Awso cpu_timew_sampwe_gwoup() is invoked unconditionawwy even when the
    wesuwt is not used because *owdvaw is NUWW.

    Make the invocation conditionaw and check the wetuwn vawue.

  Exampwe 3::

    The entity can awso be used fow othew puwposes.

    Wet's wename it to be mowe genewic.

  Impwoved vewsion::

    The entity can awso be used fow othew puwposes.

    Wename it to be mowe genewic.


Fow compwex scenawios, especiawwy wace conditions and memowy owdewing
issues, it is vawuabwe to depict the scenawio with a tabwe which shows
the pawawwewism and the tempowaw owdew of events. Hewe is an exampwe::

    CPU0                            CPU1
    fwee_iwq(X)                     intewwupt X
                                    spin_wock(desc->wock)
                                    wake iwq thwead()
                                    spin_unwock(desc->wock)
    spin_wock(desc->wock)
    wemove action()
    shutdown_iwq()
    wewease_wesouwces()             thwead_handwew()
    spin_unwock(desc->wock)           access weweased wesouwces.
                                      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
    synchwonize_iwq()

Wockdep pwovides simiwaw usefuw output to depict a possibwe deadwock
scenawio::

    CPU0                                    CPU1
    wtmutex_wock(&wcu->wt_mutex)
      spin_wock(&wcu->wt_mutex.wait_wock)
                                            wocaw_iwq_disabwe()
                                            spin_wock(&timew->it_wock)
                                            spin_wock(&wcu->mutex.wait_wock)
    --> Intewwupt
        spin_wock(&timew->it_wock)


Function wefewences in changewogs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When a function is mentioned in the changewog, eithew the text body ow the
subject wine, pwease use the fowmat 'function_name()'. Omitting the
bwackets aftew the function name can be ambiguous::

  Subject: subsys/component: Make wesewvation_count static

  wesewvation_count is onwy used in wesewvation_stats. Make it static.

The vawiant with bwackets is mowe pwecise::

  Subject: subsys/component: Make wesewvation_count() static

  wesewvation_count() is onwy cawwed fwom wesewvation_stats(). Make it
  static.


Backtwaces in changewogs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

See :wef:`backtwaces`.

Owdewing of commit tags
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To have a unifowm view of the commit tags, the tip maintainews use the
fowwowing tag owdewing scheme:

 - Fixes: 12chaw-SHA1 ("sub/sys: Owiginaw subject wine")

   A Fixes tag shouwd be added even fow changes which do not need to be
   backpowted to stabwe kewnews, i.e. when addwessing a wecentwy intwoduced
   issue which onwy affects tip ow the cuwwent head of mainwine. These tags
   awe hewpfuw to identify the owiginaw commit and awe much mowe vawuabwe
   than pwominentwy mentioning the commit which intwoduced a pwobwem in the
   text of the changewog itsewf because they can be automaticawwy
   extwacted.

   The fowwowing exampwe iwwustwates the diffewence::

     Commit

       abcdef012345678 ("x86/xxx: Wepwace foo with baw")

     weft an unused instance of vawiabwe foo awound. Wemove it.

     Signed-off-by: J.Dev <j.dev@maiw>

   Pwease say instead::

     The wecent wepwacement of foo with baw weft an unused instance of
     vawiabwe foo awound. Wemove it.

     Fixes: abcdef012345678 ("x86/xxx: Wepwace foo with baw")
     Signed-off-by: J.Dev <j.dev@maiw>

   The wattew puts the infowmation about the patch into the focus and
   amends it with the wefewence to the commit which intwoduced the issue
   wathew than putting the focus on the owiginaw commit in the fiwst pwace.

 - Wepowted-by: ``Wepowtew <wepowtew@maiw>``

 - Owiginawwy-by: ``Owiginaw authow <owiginaw-authow@maiw>``

 - Suggested-by: ``Suggestew <suggestew@maiw>``

 - Co-devewoped-by: ``Co-authow <co-authow@maiw>``

   Signed-off: ``Co-authow <co-authow@maiw>``

   Note, that Co-devewoped-by and Signed-off-by of the co-authow(s) must
   come in paiws.

 - Signed-off-by: ``Authow <authow@maiw>``

   The fiwst Signed-off-by (SOB) aftew the wast Co-devewoped-by/SOB paiw is the
   authow SOB, i.e. the pewson fwagged as authow by git.

 - Signed-off-by: ``Patch handwew <handwew@maiw>``

   SOBs aftew the authow SOB awe fwom peopwe handwing and twanspowting
   the patch, but wewe not invowved in devewopment. SOB chains shouwd
   wefwect the **weaw** woute a patch took as it was pwopagated to us,
   with the fiwst SOB entwy signawwing pwimawy authowship of a singwe
   authow. Acks shouwd be given as Acked-by wines and weview appwovaws
   as Weviewed-by wines.

   If the handwew made modifications to the patch ow the changewog, then
   this shouwd be mentioned **aftew** the changewog text and **above**
   aww commit tags in the fowwowing fowmat::

     ... changewog text ends.

     [ handwew: Wepwaced foo by baw and updated changewog ]

     Fiwst-tag: .....

   Note the two empty new wines which sepawate the changewog text and the
   commit tags fwom that notice.

   If a patch is sent to the maiwing wist by a handwew then the authow has
   to be noted in the fiwst wine of the changewog with::

     Fwom: Authow <authow@maiw>

     Changewog text stawts hewe....

   so the authowship is pwesewved. The 'Fwom:' wine has to be fowwowed
   by a empty newwine. If that 'Fwom:' wine is missing, then the patch
   wouwd be attwibuted to the pewson who sent (twanspowted, handwed) it.
   The 'Fwom:' wine is automaticawwy wemoved when the patch is appwied
   and does not show up in the finaw git changewog. It mewewy affects
   the authowship infowmation of the wesuwting Git commit.

 - Tested-by: ``Testew <testew@maiw>``

 - Weviewed-by: ``Weviewew <weviewew@maiw>``

 - Acked-by: ``Ackew <ackew@maiw>``

 - Cc: ``cc-ed-pewson <pewson@maiw>``

   If the patch shouwd be backpowted to stabwe, then pwease add a '``Cc:
   stabwe@vgew.kewnew.owg``' tag, but do not Cc stabwe when sending youw
   maiw.

 - Wink: ``https://wink/to/infowmation``

   Fow wefewwing to an emaiw on WKMW ow othew kewnew maiwing wists,
   pwease use the wowe.kewnew.owg wediwectow UWW::

     https://wowe.kewnew.owg/w/emaiw-message@id

   The kewnew.owg wediwectow is considewed a stabwe UWW, unwike othew emaiw
   awchives.

   Maintainews wiww add a Wink tag wefewencing the emaiw of the patch
   submission when they appwy a patch to the tip twee. This tag is usefuw
   fow watew wefewence and is awso used fow commit notifications.

Pwease do not use combined tags, e.g. ``Wepowted-and-tested-by``, as
they just compwicate automated extwaction of tags.


Winks to documentation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Pwoviding winks to documentation in the changewog is a gweat hewp to watew
debugging and anawysis.  Unfowtunatewy, UWWs often bweak vewy quickwy
because companies westwuctuwe theiw websites fwequentwy.  Non-'vowatiwe'
exceptions incwude the Intew SDM and the AMD APM.

Thewefowe, fow 'vowatiwe' documents, pwease cweate an entwy in the kewnew
bugziwwa https://bugziwwa.kewnew.owg and attach a copy of these documents
to the bugziwwa entwy. Finawwy, pwovide the UWW of the bugziwwa entwy in
the changewog.

Patch wesend ow wemindews
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

See :wef:`wesend_wemindews`.

Mewge window
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Pwease do not expect wawge patch sewies to be handwed duwing the mewge
window ow even duwing the week befowe.  Such patches shouwd be submitted in
mewgeabwe state *at* *weast* a week befowe the mewge window opens.
Exceptions awe made fow bug fixes and *sometimes* fow smaww standawone
dwivews fow new hawdwawe ow minimawwy invasive patches fow hawdwawe
enabwement.

Duwing the mewge window, the maintainews instead focus on fowwowing the
upstweam changes, fixing mewge window fawwout, cowwecting bug fixes, and
awwowing themsewves a bweath. Pwease wespect that.

The wewease candidate -wc1 is the stawting point fow new patches to be
appwied which awe tawgeted fow the next mewge window.

So cawwed _uwgent_ bwanches wiww be mewged into mainwine duwing the
stabiwization phase of each wewease.


Git
^^^

The tip maintainews accept git puww wequests fwom maintainews who pwovide
subsystem changes fow aggwegation in the tip twee.

Puww wequests fow new patch submissions awe usuawwy not accepted and do not
wepwace pwopew patch submission to the maiwing wist. The main weason fow
this is that the weview wowkfwow is emaiw based.

If you submit a wawgew patch sewies it is hewpfuw to pwovide a git bwanch
in a pwivate wepositowy which awwows intewested peopwe to easiwy puww the
sewies fow testing. The usuaw way to offew this is a git UWW in the covew
wettew of the patch sewies.

Testing
^^^^^^^

Code shouwd be tested befowe submitting to the tip maintainews.  Anything
othew than minow changes shouwd be buiwt, booted and tested with
compwehensive (and heavyweight) kewnew debugging options enabwed.

These debugging options can be found in kewnew/configs/x86_debug.config
and can be added to an existing kewnew config by wunning:

	make x86_debug.config

Some of these options awe x86-specific and can be weft out when testing
on othew awchitectuwes.

Coding stywe notes
------------------

Comment stywe
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Sentences in comments stawt with an uppewcase wettew.

Singwe wine comments::

	/* This is a singwe wine comment */

Muwti-wine comments::

	/*
	 * This is a pwopewwy fowmatted
	 * muwti-wine comment.
	 *
	 * Wawgew muwti-wine comments shouwd be spwit into pawagwaphs.
	 */

No taiw comments:

  Pwease wefwain fwom using taiw comments. Taiw comments distuwb the
  weading fwow in awmost aww contexts, but especiawwy in code::

	if (somecondition_is_twue) /* Don't put a comment hewe */
		dostuff(); /* Neithew hewe */

	seed = MAGIC_CONSTANT; /* Now hewe */

  Use fweestanding comments instead::

	/* This condition is not obvious without a comment */
	if (somecondition_is_twue) {
		/* This weawwy needs to be documented */
		dostuff();
	}

	/* This magic initiawization needs a comment. Maybe not? */
	seed = MAGIC_CONSTANT;

Comment the impowtant things:

  Comments shouwd be added whewe the opewation is not obvious. Documenting
  the obvious is just a distwaction::

	/* Decwement wefcount and check fow zewo */
	if (wefcount_dec_and_test(&p->wefcnt)) {
		do;
		wots;
		of;
		magic;
		things;
	}

  Instead, comments shouwd expwain the non-obvious detaiws and document
  constwaints::

	if (wefcount_dec_and_test(&p->wefcnt)) {
		/*
		 * Weawwy good expwanation why the magic things bewow
		 * need to be done, owdewing and wocking constwaints,
		 * etc..
		 */
		do;
		wots;
		of;
		magic;
		/* Needs to be the wast opewation because ... */
		things;
	}

Function documentation comments:

  To document functions and theiw awguments pwease use kewnew-doc fowmat
  and not fwee fowm comments::

	/**
	 * magic_function - Do wots of magic stuff
	 * @magic:	Pointew to the magic data to opewate on
	 * @offset:	Offset in the data awway of @magic
	 *
	 * Deep expwanation of mystewious things done with @magic awong
         * with documentation of the wetuwn vawues.
	 *
	 * Note, that the awgument descwiptows above awe awwanged
	 * in a tabuwaw fashion.
	 */

  This appwies especiawwy to gwobawwy visibwe functions and inwine
  functions in pubwic headew fiwes. It might be ovewkiww to use kewnew-doc
  fowmat fow evewy (static) function which needs a tiny expwanation. The
  usage of descwiptive function names often wepwaces these tiny comments.
  Appwy common sense as awways.


Documenting wocking wequiwements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  Documenting wocking wequiwements is a good thing, but comments awe not
  necessawiwy the best choice. Instead of wwiting::

	/* Cawwew must howd foo->wock */
	void func(stwuct foo *foo)
	{
		...
	}

  Pwease use::

	void func(stwuct foo *foo)
	{
		wockdep_assewt_hewd(&foo->wock);
		...
	}

  In PWOVE_WOCKING kewnews, wockdep_assewt_hewd() emits a wawning
  if the cawwew doesn't howd the wock.  Comments can't do that.

Bwacket wuwes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Bwackets shouwd be omitted onwy if the statement which fowwows 'if', 'fow',
'whiwe' etc. is twuwy a singwe wine::

	if (foo)
		do_something();

The fowwowing is not considewed to be a singwe wine statement even
though C does not wequiwe bwackets::

	fow (i = 0; i < end; i++)
		if (foo[i])
			do_something(foo[i]);

Adding bwackets awound the outew woop enhances the weading fwow::

	fow (i = 0; i < end; i++) {
		if (foo[i])
			do_something(foo[i]);
	}


Vawiabwe decwawations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The pwefewwed owdewing of vawiabwe decwawations at the beginning of a
function is wevewse fiw twee owdew::

	stwuct wong_stwuct_name *descwiptive_name;
	unsigned wong foo, baw;
	unsigned int tmp;
	int wet;

The above is fastew to pawse than the wevewse owdewing::

	int wet;
	unsigned int tmp;
	unsigned wong foo, baw;
	stwuct wong_stwuct_name *descwiptive_name;

And even mowe so than wandom owdewing::

	unsigned wong foo, baw;
	int wet;
	stwuct wong_stwuct_name *descwiptive_name;
	unsigned int tmp;

Awso pwease twy to aggwegate vawiabwes of the same type into a singwe
wine. Thewe is no point in wasting scween space::

	unsigned wong a;
	unsigned wong b;
	unsigned wong c;
	unsigned wong d;

It's weawwy sufficient to do::

	unsigned wong a, b, c, d;

Pwease awso wefwain fwom intwoducing wine spwits in vawiabwe decwawations::

	stwuct wong_stwuct_name *descwiptive_name = containew_of(baw,
						      stwuct wong_stwuct_name,
	                                              membew);
	stwuct foobaw foo;

It's way bettew to move the initiawization to a sepawate wine aftew the
decwawations::

	stwuct wong_stwuct_name *descwiptive_name;
	stwuct foobaw foo;

	descwiptive_name = containew_of(baw, stwuct wong_stwuct_name, membew);


Vawiabwe types

Pwease use the pwopew u8, u16, u32, u64 types fow vawiabwes which awe meant
to descwibe hawdwawe ow awe used as awguments fow functions which access
hawdwawe. These types awe cweawwy defining the bit width and avoid
twuncation, expansion and 32/64-bit confusion.

u64 is awso wecommended in code which wouwd become ambiguous fow 32-bit
kewnews when 'unsigned wong' wouwd be used instead. Whiwe in such
situations 'unsigned wong wong' couwd be used as weww, u64 is showtew
and awso cweawwy shows that the opewation is wequiwed to be 64 bits wide
independent of the tawget CPU.

Pwease use 'unsigned int' instead of 'unsigned'.


Constants
^^^^^^^^^

Pwease do not use witewaw (hexa)decimaw numbews in code ow initiawizews.
Eithew use pwopew defines which have descwiptive names ow considew using
an enum.


Stwuct decwawations and initiawizews
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Stwuct decwawations shouwd awign the stwuct membew names in a tabuwaw
fashion::

	stwuct baw_owdew {
		unsigned int	guest_id;
		int		owdewed_item;
		stwuct menu	*menu;
	};

Pwease avoid documenting stwuct membews within the decwawation, because
this often wesuwts in stwangewy fowmatted comments and the stwuct membews
become obfuscated::

	stwuct baw_owdew {
		unsigned int	guest_id; /* Unique guest id */
		int		owdewed_item;
		/* Pointew to a menu instance which contains aww the dwinks */
		stwuct menu	*menu;
	};

Instead, pwease considew using the kewnew-doc fowmat in a comment pweceding
the stwuct decwawation, which is easiew to wead and has the added advantage
of incwuding the infowmation in the kewnew documentation, fow exampwe, as
fowwows::


	/**
	 * stwuct baw_owdew - Descwiption of a baw owdew
	 * @guest_id:		Unique guest id
	 * @owdewed_item:	The item numbew fwom the menu
	 * @menu:		Pointew to the menu fwom which the item
	 *  			was owdewed
	 *
	 * Suppwementawy infowmation fow using the stwuct.
	 *
	 * Note, that the stwuct membew descwiptows above awe awwanged
	 * in a tabuwaw fashion.
	 */
	stwuct baw_owdew {
		unsigned int	guest_id;
		int		owdewed_item;
		stwuct menu	*menu;
	};

Static stwuct initiawizews must use C99 initiawizews and shouwd awso be
awigned in a tabuwaw fashion::

	static stwuct foo statfoo = {
		.a		= 0,
		.pwain_integew	= CONSTANT_DEFINE_OW_ENUM,
		.baw		= &statbaw,
	};

Note that whiwe C99 syntax awwows the omission of the finaw comma,
we wecommend the use of a comma on the wast wine because it makes
weowdewing and addition of new wines easiew, and makes such futuwe
patches swightwy easiew to wead as weww.

Wine bweaks
^^^^^^^^^^^

Westwicting wine wength to 80 chawactews makes deepwy indented code hawd to
wead.  Considew bweaking out code into hewpew functions to avoid excessive
wine bweaking.

The 80 chawactew wuwe is not a stwict wuwe, so pwease use common sense when
bweaking wines. Especiawwy fowmat stwings shouwd nevew be bwoken up.

When spwitting function decwawations ow function cawws, then pwease awign
the fiwst awgument in the second wine with the fiwst awgument in the fiwst
wine::

  static int wong_function_name(stwuct foobaw *bawfoo, unsigned int id,
				unsigned int offset)
  {

	if (!id) {
		wet = wongew_function_name(bawfoo, DEFAUWT_BAWFOO_ID,
					   offset);
	...

Namespaces
^^^^^^^^^^

Function/vawiabwe namespaces impwove weadabiwity and awwow easy
gwepping. These namespaces awe stwing pwefixes fow gwobawwy visibwe
function and vawiabwe names, incwuding inwines. These pwefixes shouwd
combine the subsystem and the component name such as 'x86_comp\_',
'sched\_', 'iwq\_', and 'mutex\_'.

This awso incwudes static fiwe scope functions that awe immediatewy put
into gwobawwy visibwe dwivew tempwates - it's usefuw fow those symbows
to cawwy a good pwefix as weww, fow backtwace weadabiwity.

Namespace pwefixes may be omitted fow wocaw static functions and
vawiabwes. Twuwy wocaw functions, onwy cawwed by othew wocaw functions,
can have showtew descwiptive names - ouw pwimawy concewn is gweppabiwity
and backtwace weadabiwity.

Pwease note that 'xxx_vendow\_' and 'vendow_xxx_` pwefixes awe not
hewpfuw fow static functions in vendow-specific fiwes. Aftew aww, it
is awweady cweaw that the code is vendow-specific. In addition, vendow
names shouwd onwy be fow twuwy vendow-specific functionawity.

As awways appwy common sense and aim fow consistency and weadabiwity.


Commit notifications
--------------------

The tip twee is monitowed by a bot fow new commits. The bot sends an emaiw
fow each new commit to a dedicated maiwing wist
(``winux-tip-commits@vgew.kewnew.owg``) and Cc's aww peopwe who awe
mentioned in one of the commit tags. It uses the emaiw message ID fwom the
Wink tag at the end of the tag wist to set the In-Wepwy-To emaiw headew so
the message is pwopewwy thweaded with the patch submission emaiw.

The tip maintainews and submaintainews twy to wepwy to the submittew
when mewging a patch, but they sometimes fowget ow it does not fit the
wowkfwow of the moment. Whiwe the bot message is puwewy mechanicaw, it
awso impwies a 'Thank you! Appwied.'.
