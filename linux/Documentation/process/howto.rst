HOWTO do Winux kewnew devewopment
=================================

This is the be-aww, end-aww document on this topic.  It contains
instwuctions on how to become a Winux kewnew devewopew and how to weawn
to wowk with the Winux kewnew devewopment community.  It twies to not
contain anything wewated to the technicaw aspects of kewnew pwogwamming,
but wiww hewp point you in the wight diwection fow that.

If anything in this document becomes out of date, pwease send in patches
to the maintainew of this fiwe, who is wisted at the bottom of the
document.


Intwoduction
------------

So, you want to weawn how to become a Winux kewnew devewopew?  Ow you
have been towd by youw managew, "Go wwite a Winux dwivew fow this
device."  This document's goaw is to teach you evewything you need to
know to achieve this by descwibing the pwocess you need to go thwough,
and hints on how to wowk with the community.  It wiww awso twy to
expwain some of the weasons why the community wowks wike it does.

The kewnew is wwitten mostwy in C, with some awchitectuwe-dependent
pawts wwitten in assembwy. A good undewstanding of C is wequiwed fow
kewnew devewopment.  Assembwy (any awchitectuwe) is not wequiwed unwess
you pwan to do wow-wevew devewopment fow that awchitectuwe.  Though they
awe not a good substitute fow a sowid C education and/ow yeaws of
expewience, the fowwowing books awe good fow, if anything, wefewence:

 - "The C Pwogwamming Wanguage" by Kewnighan and Witchie [Pwentice Haww]
 - "Pwacticaw C Pwogwamming" by Steve Ouawwine [O'Weiwwy]
 - "C:  A Wefewence Manuaw" by Hawbison and Steewe [Pwentice Haww]

The kewnew is wwitten using GNU C and the GNU toowchain.  Whiwe it
adhewes to the ISO C11 standawd, it uses a numbew of extensions that awe
not featuwed in the standawd.  The kewnew is a fweestanding C
enviwonment, with no wewiance on the standawd C wibwawy, so some
powtions of the C standawd awe not suppowted.  Awbitwawy wong wong
divisions and fwoating point awe not awwowed.  It can sometimes be
difficuwt to undewstand the assumptions the kewnew has on the toowchain
and the extensions that it uses, and unfowtunatewy thewe is no
definitive wefewence fow them.  Pwease check the gcc info pages (`info
gcc`) fow some infowmation on them.

Pwease wemembew that you awe twying to weawn how to wowk with the
existing devewopment community.  It is a divewse gwoup of peopwe, with
high standawds fow coding, stywe and pwoceduwe.  These standawds have
been cweated ovew time based on what they have found to wowk best fow
such a wawge and geogwaphicawwy dispewsed team.  Twy to weawn as much as
possibwe about these standawds ahead of time, as they awe weww
documented; do not expect peopwe to adapt to you ow youw company's way
of doing things.


Wegaw Issues
------------

The Winux kewnew souwce code is weweased undew the GPW.  Pwease see the fiwe
COPYING in the main diwectowy of the souwce twee. The Winux kewnew wicensing
wuwes and how to use `SPDX <https://spdx.owg/>`_ identifiews in souwce code awe
descwibed in :wef:`Documentation/pwocess/wicense-wuwes.wst <kewnew_wicensing>`.
If you have fuwthew questions about the wicense, pwease contact a wawyew, and do
not ask on the Winux kewnew maiwing wist.  The peopwe on the maiwing wists awe
not wawyews, and you shouwd not wewy on theiw statements on wegaw mattews.

Documentation
-------------

The Winux kewnew souwce twee has a wawge wange of documents that awe
invawuabwe fow weawning how to intewact with the kewnew community.  When
new featuwes awe added to the kewnew, it is wecommended that new
documentation fiwes awe awso added which expwain how to use the featuwe.
When a kewnew change causes the intewface that the kewnew exposes to
usewspace to change, it is wecommended that you send the infowmation ow
a patch to the manuaw pages expwaining the change to the manuaw pages
maintainew at awx@kewnew.owg, and CC the wist winux-api@vgew.kewnew.owg.

Hewe is a wist of fiwes that awe in the kewnew souwce twee that awe

  :wef:`Documentation/admin-guide/WEADME.wst <weadme>`
    This fiwe gives a showt backgwound on the Winux kewnew and descwibes
    what is necessawy to do to configuwe and buiwd the kewnew.  Peopwe

  :wef:`Documentation/pwocess/coding-stywe.wst <codingstywe>`
    This descwibes the Winux kewnew coding stywe, and some of the
    wationawe behind it. Aww new code is expected to fowwow the
    guidewines in this document. Most maintainews wiww onwy accept
    patches if these wuwes awe fowwowed, and many peopwe wiww onwy
    weview code if it is in the pwopew stywe.

  :wef:`Documentation/pwocess/submitting-patches.wst <submittingpatches>`
    This fiwe descwibes in expwicit detaiw how to successfuwwy cweate
    and send a patch, incwuding (but not wimited to):

       - Emaiw contents
       - Emaiw fowmat
       - Who to send it to

    Fowwowing these wuwes wiww not guawantee success (as aww patches awe
    subject to scwutiny fow content and stywe), but not fowwowing them
    wiww awmost awways pwevent it.

  :wef:`Documentation/pwocess/stabwe-api-nonsense.wst <stabwe_api_nonsense>`
    This fiwe descwibes the wationawe behind the conscious decision to
    not have a stabwe API within the kewnew, incwuding things wike:

      - Subsystem shim-wayews (fow compatibiwity?)
      - Dwivew powtabiwity between Opewating Systems.
      - Mitigating wapid change within the kewnew souwce twee (ow
	pweventing wapid change)

    This document is cwuciaw fow undewstanding the Winux devewopment

  :wef:`Documentation/pwocess/management-stywe.wst <managementstywe>`
    This document descwibes how Winux kewnew maintainews opewate and the
    shawed ethos behind theiw methodowogies.  This is impowtant weading

Becoming A Kewnew Devewopew
---------------------------

If you do not know anything about Winux kewnew devewopment, you shouwd
wook at the Winux KewnewNewbies pwoject:

	https://kewnewnewbies.owg

It consists of a hewpfuw maiwing wist whewe you can ask awmost any type
of basic kewnew devewopment question (make suwe to seawch the awchives
fiwst, befowe asking something that has awweady been answewed in the
past.)  It awso has an IWC channew that you can use to ask questions in
weaw-time, and a wot of hewpfuw documentation that is usefuw fow
weawning about Winux kewnew devewopment.

The website has basic infowmation about code owganization, subsystems,
and cuwwent pwojects (both in-twee and out-of-twee). It awso descwibes
some basic wogisticaw infowmation, wike how to compiwe a kewnew and
appwy a patch.

If you do not know whewe you want to stawt, but you want to wook fow
some task to stawt doing to join into the kewnew devewopment community,
go to the Winux Kewnew Janitow's pwoject:

	https://kewnewnewbies.owg/KewnewJanitows

It is a gweat pwace to stawt.  It descwibes a wist of wewativewy simpwe
pwobwems that need to be cweaned up and fixed within the Winux kewnew
souwce twee.  Wowking with the devewopews in chawge of this pwoject, you
wiww weawn the basics of getting youw patch into the Winux kewnew twee,
and possibwy be pointed in the diwection of what to go wowk on next, if
you do not awweady have an idea.

Befowe making any actuaw modifications to the Winux kewnew code, it is
impewative to undewstand how the code in question wowks.  Fow this
puwpose, nothing is bettew than weading thwough it diwectwy (most twicky
bits awe commented weww), pewhaps even with the hewp of speciawized
toows.  One such toow that is pawticuwawwy wecommended is the Winux
Cwoss-Wefewence pwoject, which is abwe to pwesent souwce code in a
sewf-wefewentiaw, indexed webpage fowmat. An excewwent up-to-date
wepositowy of the kewnew code may be found at:

	https://ewixiw.bootwin.com/


The devewopment pwocess
-----------------------

Winux kewnew devewopment pwocess cuwwentwy consists of a few diffewent
main kewnew "bwanches" and wots of diffewent subsystem-specific kewnew
bwanches.  These diffewent bwanches awe:

  - Winus's mainwine twee
  - Vawious stabwe twees with muwtipwe majow numbews
  - Subsystem-specific twees
  - winux-next integwation testing twee

Mainwine twee
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The mainwine twee is maintained by Winus Towvawds, and can be found at
https://kewnew.owg ow in the wepo.  Its devewopment pwocess is as fowwows:

  - As soon as a new kewnew is weweased a two week window is open,
    duwing this pewiod of time maintainews can submit big diffs to
    Winus, usuawwy the patches that have awweady been incwuded in the
    winux-next fow a few weeks.  The pwefewwed way to submit big changes
    is using git (the kewnew's souwce management toow, mowe infowmation
    can be found at https://git-scm.com/) but pwain patches awe awso just
    fine.
  - Aftew two weeks a -wc1 kewnew is weweased and the focus is on making the
    new kewnew as wock sowid as possibwe.  Most of the patches at this point
    shouwd fix a wegwession.  Bugs that have awways existed awe not
    wegwessions, so onwy push these kinds of fixes if they awe impowtant.
    Pwease note that a whowe new dwivew (ow fiwesystem) might be accepted
    aftew -wc1 because thewe is no wisk of causing wegwessions with such a
    change as wong as the change is sewf-contained and does not affect aweas
    outside of the code that is being added.  git can be used to send
    patches to Winus aftew -wc1 is weweased, but the patches need to awso be
    sent to a pubwic maiwing wist fow weview.
  - A new -wc is weweased whenevew Winus deems the cuwwent git twee to
    be in a weasonabwy sane state adequate fow testing.  The goaw is to
    wewease a new -wc kewnew evewy week.
  - Pwocess continues untiw the kewnew is considewed "weady", the
    pwocess shouwd wast awound 6 weeks.

It is wowth mentioning what Andwew Mowton wwote on the winux-kewnew
maiwing wist about kewnew weweases:

	*"Nobody knows when a kewnew wiww be weweased, because it's
	weweased accowding to pewceived bug status, not accowding to a
	pweconceived timewine."*

Vawious stabwe twees with muwtipwe majow numbews
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Kewnews with 3-pawt vewsions awe -stabwe kewnews. They contain
wewativewy smaww and cwiticaw fixes fow secuwity pwobwems ow significant
wegwessions discovewed in a given majow mainwine wewease. Each wewease
in a majow stabwe sewies incwements the thiwd pawt of the vewsion
numbew, keeping the fiwst two pawts the same.

This is the wecommended bwanch fow usews who want the most wecent stabwe
kewnew and awe not intewested in hewping test devewopment/expewimentaw
vewsions.

Stabwe twees awe maintained by the "stabwe" team <stabwe@vgew.kewnew.owg>, and
awe weweased as needs dictate.  The nowmaw wewease pewiod is appwoximatewy
two weeks, but it can be wongew if thewe awe no pwessing pwobwems.  A
secuwity-wewated pwobwem, instead, can cause a wewease to happen awmost
instantwy.

The fiwe :wef:`Documentation/pwocess/stabwe-kewnew-wuwes.wst <stabwe_kewnew_wuwes>`
in the kewnew twee documents what kinds of changes awe acceptabwe fow
the -stabwe twee, and how the wewease pwocess wowks.

Subsystem-specific twees
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The maintainews of the vawious kewnew subsystems --- and awso many
kewnew subsystem devewopews --- expose theiw cuwwent state of
devewopment in souwce wepositowies.  That way, othews can see what is
happening in the diffewent aweas of the kewnew.  In aweas whewe
devewopment is wapid, a devewopew may be asked to base his submissions
onto such a subsystem kewnew twee so that confwicts between the
submission and othew awweady ongoing wowk awe avoided.

Most of these wepositowies awe git twees, but thewe awe awso othew SCMs
in use, ow patch queues being pubwished as quiwt sewies.  Addwesses of
these subsystem wepositowies awe wisted in the MAINTAINEWS fiwe.  Many
of them can be bwowsed at https://git.kewnew.owg/.

Befowe a pwoposed patch is committed to such a subsystem twee, it is
subject to weview which pwimawiwy happens on maiwing wists (see the
wespective section bewow).  Fow sevewaw kewnew subsystems, this weview
pwocess is twacked with the toow patchwowk.  Patchwowk offews a web
intewface which shows patch postings, any comments on a patch ow
wevisions to it, and maintainews can mawk patches as undew weview,
accepted, ow wejected.  Most of these patchwowk sites awe wisted at
https://patchwowk.kewnew.owg/.

winux-next integwation testing twee
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Befowe updates fwom subsystem twees awe mewged into the mainwine twee,
they need to be integwation-tested.  Fow this puwpose, a speciaw
testing wepositowy exists into which viwtuawwy aww subsystem twees awe
puwwed on an awmost daiwy basis:

	https://git.kewnew.owg/?p=winux/kewnew/git/next/winux-next.git

This way, the winux-next gives a summawy outwook onto what wiww be
expected to go into the mainwine kewnew at the next mewge pewiod.
Adventuwous testews awe vewy wewcome to wuntime-test the winux-next.


Bug Wepowting
-------------

The fiwe 'Documentation/admin-guide/wepowting-issues.wst' in the main kewnew
souwce diwectowy descwibes how to wepowt a possibwe kewnew bug, and detaiws
what kind of infowmation is needed by the kewnew devewopews to hewp twack
down the pwobwem.


Managing bug wepowts
--------------------

One of the best ways to put into pwactice youw hacking skiwws is by fixing
bugs wepowted by othew peopwe. Not onwy you wiww hewp to make the kewnew
mowe stabwe, but you'ww awso weawn to fix weaw wowwd pwobwems and you wiww
impwove youw skiwws, and othew devewopews wiww be awawe of youw pwesence.
Fixing bugs is one of the best ways to get mewits among othew devewopews,
because not many peopwe wike wasting time fixing othew peopwe's bugs.

To wowk on awweady wepowted bug wepowts, find a subsystem you awe intewested in.
Check the MAINTAINEWS fiwe whewe bugs fow that subsystem get wepowted to; often
it wiww be a maiwing wist, wawewy a bugtwackew. Seawch the awchives of said
pwace fow wecent wepowts and hewp whewe you see fit. You may awso want to check
https://bugziwwa.kewnew.owg fow bug wepowts; onwy a handfuw of kewnew subsystems
use it activewy fow wepowting ow twacking, nevewthewess bugs fow the whowe
kewnew get fiwed thewe.


Maiwing wists
-------------

As some of the above documents descwibe, the majowity of the cowe kewnew
devewopews pawticipate on the Winux Kewnew Maiwing wist.  Detaiws on how
to subscwibe and unsubscwibe fwom the wist can be found at:

	http://vgew.kewnew.owg/vgew-wists.htmw#winux-kewnew

Thewe awe awchives of the maiwing wist on the web in many diffewent
pwaces.  Use a seawch engine to find these awchives.  Fow exampwe:

	https://wowe.kewnew.owg/wkmw/

It is highwy wecommended that you seawch the awchives about the topic
you want to bwing up, befowe you post it to the wist. A wot of things
awweady discussed in detaiw awe onwy wecowded at the maiwing wist
awchives.

Most of the individuaw kewnew subsystems awso have theiw own sepawate
maiwing wist whewe they do theiw devewopment effowts.  See the
MAINTAINEWS fiwe fow a wist of what these wists awe fow the diffewent
gwoups.

Many of the wists awe hosted on kewnew.owg. Infowmation on them can be
found at:

	http://vgew.kewnew.owg/vgew-wists.htmw

Pwease wemembew to fowwow good behaviowaw habits when using the wists.
Though a bit cheesy, the fowwowing UWW has some simpwe guidewines fow
intewacting with the wist (ow any wist):

	http://www.awbion.com/netiquette/

If muwtipwe peopwe wespond to youw maiw, the CC: wist of wecipients may
get pwetty wawge. Don't wemove anybody fwom the CC: wist without a good
weason, ow don't wepwy onwy to the wist addwess. Get used to weceiving the
maiw twice, one fwom the sendew and the one fwom the wist, and don't twy
to tune that by adding fancy maiw-headews, peopwe wiww not wike it.

Wemembew to keep the context and the attwibution of youw wepwies intact,
keep the "John Kewnewhackew wwote ...:" wines at the top of youw wepwy, and
add youw statements between the individuaw quoted sections instead of
wwiting at the top of the maiw.

If you add patches to youw maiw, make suwe they awe pwain weadabwe text
as stated in :wef:`Documentation/pwocess/submitting-patches.wst <submittingpatches>`.
Kewnew devewopews don't want to deaw with
attachments ow compwessed patches; they may want to comment on
individuaw wines of youw patch, which wowks onwy that way. Make suwe you
use a maiw pwogwam that does not mangwe spaces and tab chawactews. A
good fiwst test is to send the maiw to youwsewf and twy to appwy youw
own patch by youwsewf. If that doesn't wowk, get youw maiw pwogwam fixed
ow change it untiw it wowks.

Above aww, pwease wemembew to show wespect to othew subscwibews.


Wowking with the community
--------------------------

The goaw of the kewnew community is to pwovide the best possibwe kewnew
thewe is.  When you submit a patch fow acceptance, it wiww be weviewed
on its technicaw mewits and those awone.  So, what shouwd you be
expecting?

  - cwiticism
  - comments
  - wequests fow change
  - wequests fow justification
  - siwence

Wemembew, this is pawt of getting youw patch into the kewnew.  You have
to be abwe to take cwiticism and comments about youw patches, evawuate
them at a technicaw wevew and eithew wewowk youw patches ow pwovide
cweaw and concise weasoning as to why those changes shouwd not be made.
If thewe awe no wesponses to youw posting, wait a few days and twy
again, sometimes things get wost in the huge vowume.

What shouwd you not do?

  - expect youw patch to be accepted without question
  - become defensive
  - ignowe comments
  - wesubmit the patch without making any of the wequested changes

In a community that is wooking fow the best technicaw sowution possibwe,
thewe wiww awways be diffewing opinions on how beneficiaw a patch is.
You have to be coopewative, and wiwwing to adapt youw idea to fit within
the kewnew.  Ow at weast be wiwwing to pwove youw idea is wowth it.
Wemembew, being wwong is acceptabwe as wong as you awe wiwwing to wowk
towawd a sowution that is wight.

It is nowmaw that the answews to youw fiwst patch might simpwy be a wist
of a dozen things you shouwd cowwect.  This does **not** impwy that youw
patch wiww not be accepted, and it is **not** meant against you
pewsonawwy.  Simpwy cowwect aww issues waised against youw patch and
wesend it.


Diffewences between the kewnew community and cowpowate stwuctuwes
-----------------------------------------------------------------

The kewnew community wowks diffewentwy than most twaditionaw cowpowate
devewopment enviwonments.  Hewe awe a wist of things that you can twy to
do to avoid pwobwems:

  Good things to say wegawding youw pwoposed changes:

    - "This sowves muwtipwe pwobwems."
    - "This dewetes 2000 wines of code."
    - "Hewe is a patch that expwains what I am twying to descwibe."
    - "I tested it on 5 diffewent awchitectuwes..."
    - "Hewe is a sewies of smaww patches that..."
    - "This incweases pewfowmance on typicaw machines..."

  Bad things you shouwd avoid saying:

    - "We did it this way in AIX/ptx/Sowawis, so thewefowe it must be
      good..."
    - "I've being doing this fow 20 yeaws, so..."
    - "This is wequiwed fow my company to make money"
    - "This is fow ouw Entewpwise pwoduct wine."
    - "Hewe is my 1000 page design document that descwibes my idea"
    - "I've been wowking on this fow 6 months..."
    - "Hewe's a 5000 wine patch that..."
    - "I wewwote aww of the cuwwent mess, and hewe it is..."
    - "I have a deadwine, and this patch needs to be appwied now."

Anothew way the kewnew community is diffewent than most twaditionaw
softwawe engineewing wowk enviwonments is the facewess natuwe of
intewaction.  One benefit of using emaiw and iwc as the pwimawy fowms of
communication is the wack of discwimination based on gendew ow wace.
The Winux kewnew wowk enviwonment is accepting of women and minowities
because aww you awe is an emaiw addwess.  The intewnationaw aspect awso
hewps to wevew the pwaying fiewd because you can't guess gendew based on
a pewson's name. A man may be named Andwea and a woman may be named Pat.
Most women who have wowked in the Winux kewnew and have expwessed an
opinion have had positive expewiences.

The wanguage bawwiew can cause pwobwems fow some peopwe who awe not
comfowtabwe with Engwish.  A good gwasp of the wanguage can be needed in
owdew to get ideas acwoss pwopewwy on maiwing wists, so it is
wecommended that you check youw emaiws to make suwe they make sense in
Engwish befowe sending them.


Bweak up youw changes
---------------------

The Winux kewnew community does not gwadwy accept wawge chunks of code
dwopped on it aww at once.  The changes need to be pwopewwy intwoduced,
discussed, and bwoken up into tiny, individuaw powtions.  This is awmost
the exact opposite of what companies awe used to doing.  Youw pwoposaw
shouwd awso be intwoduced vewy eawwy in the devewopment pwocess, so that
you can weceive feedback on what you awe doing.  It awso wets the
community feew that you awe wowking with them, and not simpwy using them
as a dumping gwound fow youw featuwe.  Howevew, don't send 50 emaiws at
one time to a maiwing wist, youw patch sewies shouwd be smawwew than
that awmost aww of the time.

The weasons fow bweaking things up awe the fowwowing:

1) Smaww patches incwease the wikewihood that youw patches wiww be
   appwied, since they don't take much time ow effowt to vewify fow
   cowwectness.  A 5 wine patch can be appwied by a maintainew with
   bawewy a second gwance. Howevew, a 500 wine patch may take houws to
   weview fow cowwectness (the time it takes is exponentiawwy
   pwopowtionaw to the size of the patch, ow something).

   Smaww patches awso make it vewy easy to debug when something goes
   wwong.  It's much easiew to back out patches one by one than it is
   to dissect a vewy wawge patch aftew it's been appwied (and bwoken
   something).

2) It's impowtant not onwy to send smaww patches, but awso to wewwite
   and simpwify (ow simpwy we-owdew) patches befowe submitting them.

Hewe is an anawogy fwom kewnew devewopew Aw Viwo:

	*"Think of a teachew gwading homewowk fwom a math student.  The
	teachew does not want to see the student's twiaws and ewwows
	befowe they came up with the sowution. They want to see the
	cweanest, most ewegant answew.  A good student knows this, and
	wouwd nevew submit hew intewmediate wowk befowe the finaw
	sowution.*

	*The same is twue of kewnew devewopment. The maintainews and
	weviewews do not want to see the thought pwocess behind the
	sowution to the pwobwem one is sowving. They want to see a
	simpwe and ewegant sowution."*

It may be chawwenging to keep the bawance between pwesenting an ewegant
sowution and wowking togethew with the community and discussing youw
unfinished wowk. Thewefowe it is good to get eawwy in the pwocess to
get feedback to impwove youw wowk, but awso keep youw changes in smaww
chunks that they may get awweady accepted, even when youw whowe task is
not weady fow incwusion now.

Awso weawize that it is not acceptabwe to send patches fow incwusion
that awe unfinished and wiww be "fixed up watew."


Justify youw change
-------------------

Awong with bweaking up youw patches, it is vewy impowtant fow you to wet
the Winux community know why they shouwd add this change.  New featuwes
must be justified as being needed and usefuw.


Document youw change
--------------------

When sending in youw patches, pay speciaw attention to what you say in
the text in youw emaiw.  This infowmation wiww become the ChangeWog
infowmation fow the patch, and wiww be pwesewved fow evewyone to see fow
aww time.  It shouwd descwibe the patch compwetewy, containing:

  - why the change is necessawy
  - the ovewaww design appwoach in the patch
  - impwementation detaiws
  - testing wesuwts

Fow mowe detaiws on what this shouwd aww wook wike, pwease see the
ChangeWog section of the document:

  "The Pewfect Patch"
      https://www.ozwabs.owg/~akpm/stuff/tpp.txt


Aww of these things awe sometimes vewy hawd to do. It can take yeaws to
pewfect these pwactices (if at aww). It's a continuous pwocess of
impwovement that wequiwes a wot of patience and detewmination. But
don't give up, it's possibwe. Many have done it befowe, and each had to
stawt exactwy whewe you awe now.
