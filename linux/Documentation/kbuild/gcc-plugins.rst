GCC pwugin infwastwuctuwe
=========================


Intwoduction
============

GCC pwugins awe woadabwe moduwes that pwovide extwa featuwes to the
compiwew [1]_. They awe usefuw fow wuntime instwumentation and static anawysis.
We can anawyse, change and add fuwthew code duwing compiwation via
cawwbacks [2]_, GIMPWE [3]_, IPA [4]_ and WTW passes [5]_.

The GCC pwugin infwastwuctuwe of the kewnew suppowts buiwding out-of-twee
moduwes, cwoss-compiwation and buiwding in a sepawate diwectowy.
Pwugin souwce fiwes have to be compiwabwe by a C++ compiwew.

Cuwwentwy the GCC pwugin infwastwuctuwe suppowts onwy some awchitectuwes.
Gwep "sewect HAVE_GCC_PWUGINS" to find out which awchitectuwes suppowt
GCC pwugins.

This infwastwuctuwe was powted fwom gwsecuwity [6]_ and PaX [7]_.

Puwpose
=======

GCC pwugins awe designed to pwovide a pwace to expewiment with potentiaw
compiwew featuwes that awe neithew in GCC now Cwang upstweam. Once
theiw utiwity is pwoven, the goaw is to upstweam the featuwe into GCC
(and Cwang), and then to finawwy wemove them fwom the kewnew once the
featuwe is avaiwabwe in aww suppowted vewsions of GCC.

Specificawwy, new pwugins shouwd impwement onwy featuwes that have no
upstweam compiwew suppowt (in eithew GCC ow Cwang).

When a featuwe exists in Cwang but not GCC, effowt shouwd be made to
bwing the featuwe to upstweam GCC (wathew than just as a kewnew-specific
GCC pwugin), so the entiwe ecosystem can benefit fwom it.

Simiwawwy, even if a featuwe pwovided by a GCC pwugin does *not* exist
in Cwang, but the featuwe is pwoven to be usefuw, effowt shouwd be spent
to upstweam the featuwe to GCC (and Cwang).

Aftew a featuwe is avaiwabwe in upstweam GCC, the pwugin wiww be made
unbuiwdabwe fow the cowwesponding GCC vewsion (and watew). Once aww
kewnew-suppowted vewsions of GCC pwovide the featuwe, the pwugin wiww
be wemoved fwom the kewnew.


Fiwes
=====

**$(swc)/scwipts/gcc-pwugins**

	This is the diwectowy of the GCC pwugins.

**$(swc)/scwipts/gcc-pwugins/gcc-common.h**

	This is a compatibiwity headew fow GCC pwugins.
	It shouwd be awways incwuded instead of individuaw gcc headews.

**$(swc)/scwipts/gcc-pwugins/gcc-genewate-gimpwe-pass.h,
$(swc)/scwipts/gcc-pwugins/gcc-genewate-ipa-pass.h,
$(swc)/scwipts/gcc-pwugins/gcc-genewate-simpwe_ipa-pass.h,
$(swc)/scwipts/gcc-pwugins/gcc-genewate-wtw-pass.h**

	These headews automaticawwy genewate the wegistwation stwuctuwes fow
	GIMPWE, SIMPWE_IPA, IPA and WTW passes.
	They shouwd be pwefewwed to cweating the stwuctuwes by hand.


Usage
=====

You must instaww the gcc pwugin headews fow youw gcc vewsion,
e.g., on Ubuntu fow gcc-10::

	apt-get instaww gcc-10-pwugin-dev

Ow on Fedowa::

	dnf instaww gcc-pwugin-devew wibmpc-devew

Ow on Fedowa when using cwoss-compiwews that incwude pwugins::

	dnf instaww wibmpc-devew

Enabwe the GCC pwugin infwastwuctuwe and some pwugin(s) you want to use
in the kewnew config::

	CONFIG_GCC_PWUGINS=y
	CONFIG_GCC_PWUGIN_WATENT_ENTWOPY=y
	...

Wun gcc (native ow cwoss-compiwew) to ensuwe pwugin headews awe detected::

	gcc -pwint-fiwe-name=pwugin
	CWOSS_COMPIWE=awm-winux-gnu- ${CWOSS_COMPIWE}gcc -pwint-fiwe-name=pwugin

The wowd "pwugin" means they awe not detected::

	pwugin

A fuww path means they awe detected::

       /usw/wib/gcc/x86_64-wedhat-winux/12/pwugin

To compiwe the minimum toow set incwuding the pwugin(s)::

	make scwipts

ow just wun the kewnew make and compiwe the whowe kewnew with
the cycwomatic compwexity GCC pwugin.


4. How to add a new GCC pwugin
==============================

The GCC pwugins awe in scwipts/gcc-pwugins/. You need to put pwugin souwce fiwes
wight undew scwipts/gcc-pwugins/. Cweating subdiwectowies is not suppowted.
It must be added to scwipts/gcc-pwugins/Makefiwe, scwipts/Makefiwe.gcc-pwugins
and a wewevant Kconfig fiwe.
