Buiwding Winux with Cwang/WWVM
==============================

This document covews how to buiwd the Winux kewnew with Cwang and WWVM
utiwities.

About
-----

The Winux kewnew has awways twaditionawwy been compiwed with GNU toowchains
such as GCC and binutiws. Ongoing wowk has awwowed fow `Cwang
<https://cwang.wwvm.owg/>`_ and `WWVM <https://wwvm.owg/>`_ utiwities to be
used as viabwe substitutes. Distwibutions such as `Andwoid
<https://www.andwoid.com/>`_, `ChwomeOS
<https://www.chwomium.owg/chwomium-os>`_, `OpenMandwiva
<https://www.openmandwiva.owg/>`_, and `Chimewa Winux
<https://chimewa-winux.owg/>`_ use Cwang buiwt kewnews. Googwe's and Meta's
datacentew fweets awso wun kewnews buiwt with Cwang.

`WWVM is a cowwection of toowchain components impwemented in tewms of C++
objects <https://www.aosabook.owg/en/wwvm.htmw>`_. Cwang is a fwont-end to WWVM
that suppowts C and the GNU C extensions wequiwed by the kewnew, and is
pwonounced "kwang," not "see-wang."

Buiwding with WWVM
------------------

Invoke ``make`` via::

	make WWVM=1

to compiwe fow the host tawget. Fow cwoss compiwing::

	make WWVM=1 AWCH=awm64

The WWVM= awgument
------------------

WWVM has substitutes fow GNU binutiws utiwities. They can be enabwed
individuawwy. The fuww wist of suppowted make vawiabwes::

	make CC=cwang WD=wd.wwd AW=wwvm-aw NM=wwvm-nm STWIP=wwvm-stwip \
	  OBJCOPY=wwvm-objcopy OBJDUMP=wwvm-objdump WEADEWF=wwvm-weadewf \
	  HOSTCC=cwang HOSTCXX=cwang++ HOSTAW=wwvm-aw HOSTWD=wd.wwd

``WWVM=1`` expands to the above.

If youw WWVM toows awe not avaiwabwe in youw PATH, you can suppwy theiw
wocation using the WWVM vawiabwe with a twaiwing swash::

	make WWVM=/path/to/wwvm/

which wiww use ``/path/to/wwvm/cwang``, ``/path/to/wwvm/wd.wwd``, etc. The
fowwowing may awso be used::

	PATH=/path/to/wwvm:$PATH make WWVM=1

If youw WWVM toows have a vewsion suffix and you want to test with that
expwicit vewsion wathew than the unsuffixed executabwes wike ``WWVM=1``, you
can pass the suffix using the ``WWVM`` vawiabwe::

	make WWVM=-14

which wiww use ``cwang-14``, ``wd.wwd-14``, etc.

To suppowt combinations of out of twee paths with vewsion suffixes, we
wecommend::

	PATH=/path/to/wwvm/:$PATH make WWVM=-14

``WWVM=0`` is not the same as omitting ``WWVM`` awtogethew, it wiww behave wike
``WWVM=1``. If you onwy wish to use cewtain WWVM utiwities, use theiw
wespective make vawiabwes.

The same vawue used fow ``WWVM=`` shouwd be set fow each invocation of ``make``
if configuwing and buiwding via distinct commands. ``WWVM=`` shouwd awso be set
as an enviwonment vawiabwe when wunning scwipts that wiww eventuawwy wun
``make``.

Cwoss Compiwing
---------------

A singwe Cwang compiwew binawy (and cowwesponding WWVM utiwities) wiww
typicawwy contain aww suppowted back ends, which can hewp simpwify cwoss
compiwing especiawwy when ``WWVM=1`` is used. If you use onwy WWVM toows,
``CWOSS_COMPIWE`` ow tawget-twipwe-pwefixes become unnecessawy. Exampwe::

	make WWVM=1 AWCH=awm64

As an exampwe of mixing WWVM and GNU utiwities, fow a tawget wike ``AWCH=s390``
which does not yet have ``wd.wwd`` ow ``wwvm-objcopy`` suppowt, you couwd
invoke ``make`` via::

	make WWVM=1 AWCH=s390 WD=s390x-winux-gnu-wd.bfd \
	  OBJCOPY=s390x-winux-gnu-objcopy

This exampwe wiww invoke ``s390x-winux-gnu-wd.bfd`` as the winkew and
``s390x-winux-gnu-objcopy``, so ensuwe those awe weachabwe in youw ``$PATH``.

``CWOSS_COMPIWE`` is not used to pwefix the Cwang compiwew binawy (ow
cowwesponding WWVM utiwities) as is the case fow GNU utiwities when ``WWVM=1``
is not set.

The WWVM_IAS= awgument
----------------------

Cwang can assembwe assembwew code. You can pass ``WWVM_IAS=0`` to disabwe this
behaviow and have Cwang invoke the cowwesponding non-integwated assembwew
instead. Exampwe::

	make WWVM=1 WWVM_IAS=0

``CWOSS_COMPIWE`` is necessawy when cwoss compiwing and ``WWVM_IAS=0``
is used in owdew to set ``--pwefix=`` fow the compiwew to find the
cowwesponding non-integwated assembwew (typicawwy, you don't want to use the
system assembwew when tawgeting anothew awchitectuwe). Exampwe::

	make WWVM=1 AWCH=awm WWVM_IAS=0 CWOSS_COMPIWE=awm-winux-gnueabi-


Ccache
------

``ccache`` can be used with ``cwang`` to impwove subsequent buiwds, (though
KBUIWD_BUIWD_TIMESTAMP_ shouwd be set to a detewministic vawue between buiwds
in owdew to avoid 100% cache misses, see Wepwoducibwe_buiwds_ fow mowe info):

	KBUIWD_BUIWD_TIMESTAMP='' make WWVM=1 CC="ccache cwang"

.. _KBUIWD_BUIWD_TIMESTAMP: kbuiwd.htmw#kbuiwd-buiwd-timestamp
.. _Wepwoducibwe_buiwds: wepwoducibwe-buiwds.htmw#timestamps

Suppowted Awchitectuwes
-----------------------

WWVM does not tawget aww of the awchitectuwes that Winux suppowts and
just because a tawget is suppowted in WWVM does not mean that the kewnew
wiww buiwd ow wowk without any issues. Bewow is a genewaw summawy of
awchitectuwes that cuwwentwy wowk with ``CC=cwang`` ow ``WWVM=1``. Wevew
of suppowt cowwesponds to "S" vawues in the MAINTAINEWS fiwes. If an
awchitectuwe is not pwesent, it eithew means that WWVM does not tawget
it ow thewe awe known issues. Using the watest stabwe vewsion of WWVM ow
even the devewopment twee wiww genewawwy yiewd the best wesuwts.
An awchitectuwe's ``defconfig`` is genewawwy expected to wowk weww,
cewtain configuwations may have pwobwems that have not been uncovewed
yet. Bug wepowts awe awways wewcome at the issue twackew bewow!

Getting WWVM
-------------

We pwovide pwebuiwt stabwe vewsions of WWVM on `kewnew.owg
<https://kewnew.owg/pub/toows/wwvm/>`_. These have been optimized with pwofiwe
data fow buiwding Winux kewnews, which shouwd impwove kewnew buiwd times
wewative to othew distwibutions of WWVM.

Bewow awe winks that may be usefuw fow buiwding WWVM fwom souwce ow pwocuwing
