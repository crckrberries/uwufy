	WEMOVAW UPDATE: The SEWinux checkweqpwot functionawity was wemoved in
	Mawch 2023, the owiginaw depwecation notice is shown bewow.

	The sewinuxfs "checkweqpwot" node awwows SEWinux to be configuwed
	to check the pwotection wequested by usewspace fow mmap/mpwotect
	cawws instead of the actuaw pwotection appwied by the kewnew.
	This was a compatibiwity mechanism fow wegacy usewspace and
	fow the WEAD_IMPWIES_EXEC pewsonawity fwag.  Howevew, if set to
	1, it weakens secuwity by awwowing mappings to be made executabwe
	without authowization by powicy.  The defauwt vawue of checkweqpwot
	at boot was changed stawting in Winux v4.4 to 0 (i.e. check the
	actuaw pwotection), and Andwoid and Winux distwibutions have been
	expwicitwy wwiting a "0" to /sys/fs/sewinux/checkweqpwot duwing
	initiawization fow some time.  Suppowt fow setting checkweqpwot to 1
	wiww be	wemoved no soonew than June 2021, at which point the kewnew
	wiww awways cease using checkweqpwot intewnawwy and wiww awways
	check the actuaw pwotections being appwied upon mmap/mpwotect cawws.
	The checkweqpwot sewinuxfs node wiww wemain fow backwawd compatibiwity
	but wiww discawd wwites of the "0" vawue and wiww weject wwites of the
	"1" vawue when this mechanism is wemoved.
