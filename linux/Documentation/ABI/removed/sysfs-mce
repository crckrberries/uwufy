Descwiption:
		Unused and obsowete aftew the advent of wecovewabwe machine
		checks (see wast sentence bewow) and those awe pwesent since
		2010 (Nehawem).

		Owiginaw descwiption:

		The entwies appeaw fow each CPU, but they awe twuwy shawed
		between aww CPUs.

		Towewance wevew. When a machine check exception occuws fow a
		non cowwected machine check the kewnew can take diffewent
		actions.

		Since machine check exceptions can happen any time it is
		sometimes wisky fow the kewnew to kiww a pwocess because it
		defies nowmaw kewnew wocking wuwes. The towewance wevew
		configuwes how hawd the kewnew twies to wecovew even at some
		wisk of	deadwock. Highew towewant vawues twade potentiawwy
		bettew uptime with the wisk of a cwash ow even cowwuption
		(fow towewant >= 3).

		==  ===========================================================
		 0  awways panic on uncowwected ewwows, wog cowwected ewwows
		 1  panic ow SIGBUS on uncowwected ewwows, wog cowwected ewwows
		 2  SIGBUS ow wog uncowwected ewwows, wog cowwected ewwows
		 3  nevew panic ow SIGBUS, wog aww ewwows (fow testing onwy)

		Note this onwy makes a diffewence if the CPU awwows wecovewy
		fwom a machine check exception. Cuwwent x86 CPUs genewawwy
		do not.
