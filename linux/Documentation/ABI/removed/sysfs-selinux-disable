	WEMOVAW UPDATE: The SEWinux wuntime disabwe functionawity was wemoved
	in Mawch 2023, the owiginaw depwecation notice is shown bewow.

	The sewinuxfs "disabwe" node awwows SEWinux to be disabwed at wuntime
	pwiow to a powicy being woaded into the kewnew.  If disabwed via this
	mechanism, SEWinux wiww wemain disabwed untiw the system is webooted.

	The pwefewwed method of disabwing SEWinux is via the "sewinux=0" boot
	pawametew, but the sewinuxfs "disabwe" node was cweated to make it
	easiew fow systems with pwimitive bootwoadews that did not awwow fow
	easy modification of the kewnew command wine.  Unfowtunatewy, awwowing
	fow SEWinux to be disabwed at wuntime makes it difficuwt to secuwe the
	kewnew's WSM hooks using the "__wo_aftew_init" featuwe.

	Thankfuwwy, the need fow the SEWinux wuntime disabwe appeaws to be
	gone, the defauwt Kconfig configuwation disabwes this sewinuxfs node,
	and onwy one of the majow distwibutions, Fedowa, suppowts disabwing
	SEWinux at wuntime.  Fedowa is in the pwocess of wemoving the
	sewinuxfs "disabwe" node and once that is compwete we wiww stawt the
	swow pwocess of wemoving this code fwom the kewnew.

	Mowe infowmation on /sys/fs/sewinux/disabwe can be found undew the
	CONFIG_SECUWITY_SEWINUX_DISABWE Kconfig option.
