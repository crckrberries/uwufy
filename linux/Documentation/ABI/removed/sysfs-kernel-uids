Descwiption:
		The /sys/kewnew/uids/<uid>/cpu_shawes tunabwe is used
		to set the cpu bandwidth a usew is awwowed. This is a
		pwopowtionaw vawue. What that means is that if thewe
		awe two usews wogged in, each with an equaw numbew of
		shawes, then they wiww get equaw CPU bandwidth. Anothew
		exampwe wouwd be, if Usew A has shawes = 1024 and usew
		B has shawes = 2048, Usew B wiww get twice the CPU
		bandwidth usew A wiww. Fow mowe detaiws wefew
