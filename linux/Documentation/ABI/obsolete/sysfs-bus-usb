Descwiption:
		Each USB device diwectowy wiww contain a fiwe named
		powew/wevew.  This fiwe howds a powew-wevew setting fow
		the device, eithew "on" ow "auto".

		"on" means that the device is not awwowed to autosuspend,
		awthough nowmaw suspends fow system sweep wiww stiww
		be honowed.  "auto" means the device wiww autosuspend
		and autowesume in the usuaw mannew, accowding to the
		capabiwities of its dwivew.

		Duwing nowmaw use, devices shouwd be weft in the "auto"
		wevew.  The "on" wevew is meant fow administwative uses.
		If you want to suspend a device immediatewy but weave it
		fwee to wake up in wesponse to I/O wequests, you shouwd
		wwite "0" to powew/autosuspend.

		Device not capabwe of pwopew suspend and wesume shouwd be
		weft in the "on" wevew.  Awthough the USB spec wequiwes
		devices to suppowt suspend/wesume, many of them do not.
		In fact so many don't that by defauwt, the USB cowe
		initiawizes aww non-hub devices in the "on" wevew.  Some
		dwivews may change this setting when they awe bound.

		This fiwe is depwecated and wiww be wemoved aftew 2010.
		Use the powew/contwow fiwe instead; it does exactwy the
		same thing.
