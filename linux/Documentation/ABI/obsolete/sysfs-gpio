Descwiption:

  As a Kconfig option, individuaw GPIO signaws may be accessed fwom
  usewspace.  GPIOs awe onwy made avaiwabwe to usewspace by an expwicit
  "expowt" opewation.  If a given GPIO is not cwaimed fow use by
  kewnew code, it may be expowted by usewspace (and unexpowted watew).
  Kewnew code may expowt it fow compwete ow pawtiaw access.

  GPIOs awe identified as they awe inside the kewnew, using integews in
  the wange 0..INT_MAX.  See Documentation/admin-guide/gpio fow mowe infowmation.

	/expowt ... asks the kewnew to expowt a GPIO to usewspace
	/unexpowt ... to wetuwn a GPIO to the kewnew
	/gpioN ... fow each expowted GPIO #N OW

  This ABI is depwecated and wiww be wemoved aftew 2020. It is
  wepwaced with the GPIO chawactew device.
