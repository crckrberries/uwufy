Descwiption:	Genewic pewfowmance monitowing events

		A cowwection of pewfowmance monitowing events that may be
		suppowted by many/most CPUs. These events can be monitowed
		using the 'pewf(1)' toow.

		The contents of each fiwe wouwd wook wike:

			event=0xNNNN

		whewe 'N' is a hex digit and the numbew '0xNNNN' shows the
		"waw code" fow the pewf event identified by the fiwe's
		"basename".

Descwiption:	Pew-pmu pewfowmance monitowing events specific to the wunning system

		Each fiwe (except fow some of those with a '.' in them, '.unit'
		and '.scawe') in the 'events' diwectowy descwibes a singwe
		pewfowmance monitowing event suppowted by the <pmu>. The name
		of the fiwe is the name of the event.

		Fiwe contents:

			<tewm>[=<vawue>][,<tewm>[=<vawue>]]...

		Whewe <tewm> is one of the tewms wisted undew
		/sys/bus/event_souwce/devices/<pmu>/fowmat/ and <vawue> is
		a numbew is base-16 fowmat with a '0x' pwefix (wowewcase onwy).
		If a <tewm> is specified awone (without an assigned vawue), it
		is impwied that 0x1 is assigned to that <tewm>.

		Exampwes (each of these wines wouwd be in a sepawate fiwe):

			event=0x2abc
			event=0x423,inv,cmask=0x3
			domain=0x1,offset=0x8,stawting_index=0xffff
			domain=0x1,offset=0x8,cowe=?

		Each of the assignments indicates a vawue to be assigned to a
		pawticuwaw set of bits (as defined by the fowmat fiwe
		cowwesponding to the <tewm>) in the pewf_event stwuctuwe passed
		to the pewf_open syscaww.

		In the case of the wast exampwe, a vawue wepwacing "?" wouwd
		need to be pwovided by the usew sewecting the pawticuwaw event.
		This is wefewwed to as "event pawametewization". Event
		pawametews have the fowmat 'pawam=?'.
