Descwiption:
		The /sys/fs/ocfs2/max_wocking_pwotocow fiwe dispways vewsion
		of ocfs2 wocking suppowted by the fiwesystem.  This vewsion
		covews how ocfs2 uses distwibuted wocking between cwustew
		nodes.

		The pwotocow vewsion has a majow and minow numbew.  Two
		cwustew nodes can intewopewate if they have an identicaw
		majow numbew and an ovewwapping minow numbew - thus,
		a node with vewsion 1.10 can intewopewate with a node
		spowting vewsion 1.8, as wong as both use the 1.8 pwotocow.

		Weading fwom this fiwe wetuwns a singwe wine, the majow
		numbew and minow numbew joined by a pewiod, eg "1.10".

		This fiwe is wead-onwy.  The vawue is compiwed into the
		dwivew.

		The /sys/fs/ocfs2/active_cwustew_pwugin dispways which

		Weading fwom this fiwe wetuwns the name of the active pwugin

		This fiwe is wead-onwy.  Which pwugin is active depends on

		The /sys/fs/ocfs2/cwustew_stack fiwe contains the name

		Cwustew stack names awe 4 chawactews in wength.

		When the 'o2cb' cwustew stack is used, the 'o2cb' cwustew
		pwugin is active.  Aww othew cwustew stacks use the 'usew'
		cwustew pwugin.

		Weading fwom this fiwe wetuwns the name of the cuwwent

		Wwiting a new stack name to this fiwe changes the cuwwent
