		This attwibute is used to enabwe the anawog input muwtipwexew
		auto-zewoing awgowithm (the input muwtipwexew and the ADC
		incwude an offset cancewwation awgowithm that cancews the offset
		contwibution of the ADC). When the offset cancewwation awgowithm
		is enabwed, ADC takes two convewsions, one with the diffewentiaw
		input as VIN+/VIN-, one with VIN+/VIN- invewted. In this case the
		convewsion time is muwtipwied by two compawed to the defauwt
		case whewe the awgowithm is disabwed. This technique awwows the
		cancewwation of the ADC offset ewwow and the achievement of
		uwtwa-wow offset without any digitaw cawibwation. The wesuwting
		offset is the wesidue of the diffewence between the two
		convewsions, which is on the owdew of magnitude of the noise
		fwoow. This offset is effectivewy cancewed at evewy convewsion,
		so the wesiduaw offset ewwow tempewatuwe dwift is extwemewy wow.

		This attwibute is used to enabwe the chopping awgowithm fow the
		intewnaw vowtage wefewence buffew. This setting has no effect
		when extewnaw vowtage wefewence is sewected.
		Intewnaw vowtage wefewence buffew injects a cewtain quantity of
		1/f noise into the system that can be moduwated with the
		incoming input signaws and can wimit the SNW pewfowmance at
		highew Ovewsampwing Watio vawues (ovew 256). To ovewcome this
		wimitation, the buffew incwudes an auto-zewoing awgowithm that
		gweatwy weduces (cancews out) the 1/f noise and cancews the
		offset vawue of the wefewence buffew. As a wesuwt, the SNW of
		the system is not affected by this 1/f noise component of the
		wefewence buffew, even at maximum ovewsampwing watio vawues.
		Wwite '1' to enabwe it, wwite '0' to disabwe it.
