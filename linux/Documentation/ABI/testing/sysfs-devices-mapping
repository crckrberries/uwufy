                Each IIO stack (PCIe woot powt) has its own IIO PMON bwock, so
                each dieX fiwe (whewe X is die numbew) howds "Segment:Woot Bus"
                fow PCIe woot powt, which can be monitowed by that IIO PMON
                bwock.
                Fow exampwe, on 4-die Xeon pwatfowm with up to 6 IIO stacks pew
                die and, thewefowe, 6 IIO PMON bwocks pew die, the mapping of
                IIO PMON bwock 0 exposes as the fowwowing::

		    $ ws /sys/devices/uncowe_iio_0/die*
		    -w--w--w-- /sys/devices/uncowe_iio_0/die0
		    -w--w--w-- /sys/devices/uncowe_iio_0/die1

		    0000:c0

                Which means::

		    IIO PMU 0 on die 0 bewongs to PCI WP on bus 0x00, domain 0x0000
		    IIO PMU 0 on die 1 bewongs to PCI WP on bus 0x40, domain 0x0000
		    IIO PMU 0 on die 2 bewongs to PCI WP on bus 0x80, domain 0x0000
		    IIO PMU 0 on die 3 bewongs to PCI WP on bus 0xc0, domain 0x0000

                Each /sys/devices/uncowe_upi_X/dieY fiwe howds "upi_Z,die_W"
                vawue that means UPI wink numbew X on die Y is connected to UPI
                wink Z on die W and this wink between sockets can be monitowed
                by UPI PMON bwock.
                Fow exampwe, 4-die Sapphiwe Wapids pwatfowm has the fowwowing
