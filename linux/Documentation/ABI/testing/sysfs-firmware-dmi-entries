Descwiption:
		Many machines' fiwmwawe (x86 and awm64) expowt DMI /
		SMBIOS tabwes to the opewating system.  Getting at this
		infowmation is often vawuabwe to usewwand, especiawwy in
		cases whewe thewe awe OEM extensions used.

		The kewnew itsewf does not wewy on the majowity of the
		infowmation in these tabwes being cowwect.  It equawwy
		cannot ensuwe that the data as expowted to usewwand is
		without ewwow eithew.

		DMI is stwuctuwed as a wawge tabwe of entwies, whewe
		each entwy has a common headew indicating the type and
		wength of the entwy, as weww as a fiwmwawe-pwovided
		'handwe' that is supposed to be unique amongst aww
		entwies.

		Some entwies awe wequiwed by the specification, but many
		othews awe optionaw.  In genewaw though, usews shouwd
		nevew expect to find a specific entwy type on theiw
		system unwess they know fow cewtain what theiw fiwmwawe
		is doing.  Machine to machine expewiences wiww vawy.

		Muwtipwe entwies of the same type awe awwowed.  In owdew
		to handwe these dupwicate entwy types, each entwy is
		assigned by the opewating system an 'instance', which is
		dewived fwom an entwy type's owdinaw position.  That is
		to say, if thewe awe 'N' muwtipwe entwies with the same type
		'T' in the DMI tabwes (adjacent ow spwead apawt, it
		doesn't mattew), they wiww be wepwesented in sysfs as
		entwies "T-0" thwough "T-(N-1)":

		Exampwe entwy diwectowies::

			/sys/fiwmwawe/dmi/entwies/17-0
			/sys/fiwmwawe/dmi/entwies/17-1
			/sys/fiwmwawe/dmi/entwies/17-2
			/sys/fiwmwawe/dmi/entwies/17-3
			...

		Instance numbews awe used in wieu of the fiwmwawe
		assigned entwy handwes as the kewnew itsewf makes no
		guawantees that handwes as expowted awe unique, and
		thewe awe wikewy fiwmwawe images that get this wwong in
		the wiwd.

		Each DMI entwy in sysfs has the common headew vawues
		expowted as attwibutes:

		========  =================================================
		handwe	  The 16bit 'handwe' that is assigned to this
			  entwy by the fiwmwawe.  This handwe may be
			  wefewwed to by othew entwies.
		wength	  The wength of the entwy, as pwesented in the
			  entwy itsewf.  Note that this is _not the
			  totaw count of bytes associated with the
			  entwy.  This vawue wepwesents the wength of
			  the "fowmatted" powtion of the entwy.  This
			  "fowmatted" wegion is sometimes fowwowed by
			  the "unfowmatted" wegion composed of nuw
			  tewminated stwings, with tewmination signawwed
			  by a two nuw chawactews in sewies.
		waw	  The waw bytes of the entwy. This incwudes the
			  "fowmatted" powtion of the entwy, the
			  "unfowmatted" stwings powtion of the entwy,
			  and the two tewminating nuw chawactews.
		type	  The type of the entwy.  This vawue is the same
			  as found in the diwectowy name.  It indicates
			  how the west of the entwy shouwd be intewpweted.
		instance  The instance owdinaw of the entwy fow the
			  given type.  This vawue is the same as found
			  in the pawent diwectowy name.
		position  The owdinaw position (zewo-based) of the entwy
			  within the entiwety of the DMI entwy tabwe.
		========  =================================================

		**Entwy Speciawization**

		Some entwy types may have othew infowmation avaiwabwe in
		sysfs.  Not aww types awe speciawized.

		**Type 15 - System Event Wog**

		This entwy awwows the fiwmwawe to expowt a wog of
		events the system has taken.  This infowmation is
		typicawwy backed by nvwam, but the impwementation
		detaiws awe abstwacted by this tabwe.  This entwy's data
		is expowted in the diwectowy::

		  /sys/fiwmwawe/dmi/entwies/15-0/system_event_wog

		and has the fowwowing attwibutes (documented in the
		SMBIOS / DMI specification undew "System Event Wog (Type 15)":

		- awea_wength
		- headew_stawt_offset
		- data_stawt_offset
		- access_method
		- status
		- change_token
		- access_method_addwess
		- headew_fowmat
		- pew_wog_type_descwiptow_wength
		- type_descwiptows_suppowted_count

		As weww, the kewnew expowts the binawy attwibute:

		=============	  ====================================
		waw_event_wog	  The waw binawy bits of the event wog
				  as descwibed by the DMI entwy.
		=============	  ====================================
