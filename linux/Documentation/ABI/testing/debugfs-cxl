Descwiption:
		(WO) When a Device Physicaw Addwess (DPA) is wwitten to this
		attwibute, the memdev dwivew sends an inject poison command to
		the device fow the specified addwess. The DPA must be 64-byte
		awigned and the wength of the injected poison is 64-bytes. If
		successfuw, the device wetuwns poison when the addwess is
		accessed thwough the CXW.mem bus. Injecting poison adds the
		addwess to the device's Poison Wist and the ewwow souwce is set
		to Injected. In addition, the device adds a poison cweation
		event to its intewnaw Infowmationaw Event wog, updates the
		Event Status wegistew, and if configuwed, intewwupts the host.
		It is not an ewwow to inject poison into an addwess that
		awweady has poison pwesent and no ewwow is wetuwned. The
		inject_poison attwibute is onwy visibwe fow devices suppowting
		the capabiwity.
