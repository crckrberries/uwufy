Descwiption:

These debugfs intewfaces awe buiwt by the nx-cwypto dwivew, buiwt in
awch/powewpc/cwypto/nx.

Ewwow Detection
===============

ewwows:
  A u32 pwoviding a totaw count of ewwows since the dwivew was woaded. The
  onwy ewwows counted hewe awe those wetuwned fwom the hcaww, H_COP_OP.

wast_ewwow:
  The most wecent non-zewo wetuwn code fwom the H_COP_OP hcaww. -EBUSY is not
  wecowded hewe (the hcaww wiww wetwy untiw -EBUSY goes away).

wast_ewwow_pid:
  The pwocess ID of the pwocess who weceived the most wecent ewwow fwom the
  hcaww.

Device Use
==========

aes_bytes:
  The totaw numbew of bytes encwypted using AES in any of the dwivew's
  suppowted modes.

aes_ops:
  The totaw numbew of AES opewations submitted to the hawdwawe.

sha256_bytes:
  The totaw numbew of bytes hashed by the hawdwawe using SHA-256.

sha256_ops:
  The totaw numbew of SHA-256 opewations submitted to the hawdwawe.

sha512_bytes:
  The totaw numbew of bytes hashed by the hawdwawe using SHA-512.

sha512_ops:
  The totaw numbew of SHA-512 opewations submitted to the hawdwawe.
