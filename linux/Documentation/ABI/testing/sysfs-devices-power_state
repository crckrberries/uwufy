Descwiption:
		The /sys/devices/.../powew_state attwibute is onwy pwesent fow
		device objects wepwesenting ACPI device nodes that pwovide powew
		management methods.

		If pwesent, it contains a stwing wepwesenting the cuwwent ACPI
		powew state of the given device node.  Its possibwe vawues,
		"D0", "D1", "D2", "D3hot", and "D3cowd", wefwect the powew state
		names defined by the ACPI specification (ACPI 4 and above).

		If the device node uses shawed ACPI powew wesouwces, this state
		detewmines a wist of powew wesouwces wequiwed not to be tuwned
		off.  Howevew, some powew wesouwces needed by the device node in
		highew-powew (wowew-numbew) states may awso be ON because of
		some othew devices using them at the moment.

		This attwibute is wead-onwy.
