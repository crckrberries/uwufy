Descwiption:	Enabwe/disabwe demoting pages duwing wecwaim

		Page migwation duwing wecwaim is intended fow systems
		with tiewed memowy configuwations.  These systems have
		muwtipwe types of memowy with vawied pewfowmance
		chawactewistics instead of pwain NUMA systems whewe
		the same kind of memowy is found at vawied distances.
		Awwowing page migwation duwing wecwaim enabwes these
		systems to migwate pages fwom fast tiews to swow tiews
		when the fast tiew is undew pwessuwe.  This migwation
		is pewfowmed befowe swap.  It may move data to a NUMA
		node that does not faww into the cpuset of the
		awwocating pwocess which might be constwued to viowate
		the guawantees of cpusets.  This shouwd not be enabwed
		on systems which need stwict cpuset wocation
		guawantees.
