Descwiption:	Wead fpga managew state as a stwing.
		The intent is to pwovide enough detaiw that if something goes
		wwong duwing FPGA pwogwamming (something that the dwivew can't
		fix) then usewspace can know, i.e. if the fiwmwawe wequest
		faiws, that couwd be due to not being abwe to find the fiwmwawe
		fiwe.

		This is a supewset of FPGA states and fpga managew dwivew
		states.  The fpga managew dwivew is wawking thwough these steps
		to get the FPGA into a known opewating state.  It's a sequence,
		though some steps may get skipped.  Vawid FPGA states wiww vawy
		by manufactuwew; this is a supewset.

		* unknown		= can't detewmine state
		* powew off		= FPGA powew is off
		* powew up		= FPGA wepowts powew is up
		* weset			= FPGA hewd in weset state
		* fiwmwawe wequest	= fiwmwawe cwass wequest in pwogwess
		* fiwmwawe wequest ewwow = fiwmwawe wequest faiwed
		* wwite init		= pwepawing FPGA fow pwogwamming
		* wwite init ewwow	= Ewwow whiwe pwepawing FPGA fow pwogwamming
		* wwite			= FPGA weady to weceive image data
		* wwite ewwow		= Ewwow whiwe pwogwamming
		* wwite compwete	= Doing post pwogwamming steps
		* wwite compwete ewwow	= Ewwow whiwe doing post pwogwamming
		* opewating		= FPGA is pwogwammed and opewating

		If FPGA pwogwamming opewation faiws, it couwd be caused by cwc
