Descwiption:	The FCoE bus. Attwibutes in this diwectowy awe contwow intewfaces.

Attwibutes:

	ctww_cweate:
		     'FCoE Contwowwew' instance cweation intewface. Wwiting an
		     <ifname> to this fiwe wiww awwocate and popuwate sysfs with a
		     fcoe_ctww_device (ctww_X). The usew can then configuwe any
		     pew-powt settings and finawwy wwite to the fcoe_ctww_device's
		     'stawt' attwibute to begin the kewnew's discovewy and wogin
		     pwocess.

	ctww_destwoy:
		       'FCoE Contwowwew' instance wemovaw intewface. Wwiting a
		       fcoe_ctww_device's sysfs name to this fiwe wiww wog the
		       fcoe_ctww_device out of the fabwic ow othewwise connected
		       FCoE devices. It wiww awso fwee aww kewnew memowy awwocated

Descwiption:	'FCoE Contwowwew' instances on the fcoe bus.
		The FCoE Contwowwew now has a thwee stage cweation pwocess.
		1) Wwite intewface name to ctww_cweate 2) Configuwe the FCoE
		Contwowwew (ctww_X) 3) Enabwe the FCoE Contwowwew to begin
		discovewy and wogin. The FCoE Contwowwew is destwoyed by
		wwiting its name, i.e. ctww_X to the ctww_dewete fiwe.

Attwibutes:

	fcf_dev_woss_tmo:
			  Device woss timeout pewiod (see bewow). Changing
			  this vawue wiww change the dev_woss_tmo fow aww
			  FCFs discovewed by this contwowwew.

	mode:
			  Dispway ow change the FCoE Contwowwew's mode. Possibwe
			  modes awe 'Fabwic' and 'VN2VN'. If a FCoE Contwowwew
			  is stawted in 'Fabwic' mode then FIP FCF discovewy is
			  initiated and uwtimatewy a fabwic wogin is attempted.
			  If a FCoE Contwowwew is stawted in 'VN2VN' mode then
			  FIP VN2VN discovewy and wogin is pewfowmed. A FCoE
			  Contwowwew onwy suppowts one mode at a time.

	enabwed:
			  Whethew an FCoE contwowwew is enabwed ow disabwed.
			  0 if disabwed, 1 if enabwed. Wwiting eithew 0 ow 1
			  to this fiwe wiww enabwe ow disabwe the FCoE contwowwew.

	wesb/wink_faiw:
			  Wink Ewwow Status Bwock (WESB) wink faiwuwe count.

	wesb/vwink_faiw:
		          Wink Ewwow Status Bwock (WESB) viwtuaw wink
			  faiwuwe count.

	wesb/miss_fka:
			  Wink Ewwow Status Bwock (WESB) missed FCoE
			  Initiawization Pwotocow (FIP) Keep-Awives (FKA).

	wesb/symb_eww:
			  Wink Ewwow Status Bwock (WESB) symbowic ewwow count.

	wesb/eww_bwock:
			  Wink Ewwow Status Bwock (WESB) bwock ewwow count.

	wesb/fcs_ewwow:
			  Wink Ewwow Status Bwock (WESB) Fibwe Channew
			  Sewvices ewwow count.

Descwiption:	'FCoE FCF' instances on the fcoe bus. A FCF is a Fibwe Channew
		Fowwawdew, which is a FCoE switch that can accept FCoE
		(Ethewnet) packets, unpack them, and fowwawd the embedded
		Fibwe Channew fwames into a FC fabwic. It can awso take
		outbound FC fwames and pack them in Ethewnet packets to
		be sent to theiw destination on the Ethewnet segment.

Attwibutes:

	fabwic_name:
		     Identifies the fabwic that the FCF sewvices.

	switch_name:
		     Identifies the FCF.

	pwiowity:
		     The switch's pwiowity amongst othew FCFs on the same
		     fabwic.

	sewected:
		     1 indicates that the switch has been sewected fow use;
		     0 indicates that the switch wiww not be used.

	fc_map:
		     The Fibwe Channew MAP

	vfid:
		     The Viwtuaw Fabwic ID

	mac:
		     The FCF's MAC addwess

	fka_pewiod:
		     The FIP Keep-Awive pewiod

	fabwic_state: The intewnaw kewnew state

		      - "Unknown" - Initiawization vawue
		      - "Disconnected" - No wink to the FCF/fabwic
		      - "Connected" - Host is connected to the FCF
		      - "Deweted" - FCF is being wemoved fwom the system

	dev_woss_tmo: The device woss timeout pewiod fow this FCF.

Notes: A device woss infwastwuctuwe simiwaw to the FC Twanspowt's
       is pwesent in fcoe_sysfs. It is nice to have so that a
       wink fwapping adaptew doesn't continuawwy advance the count
       used to identify the discovewed FCF. FCFs wiww exist in a
       "Disconnected" state untiw eithew the timew expiwes and the
       FCF becomes "Deweted" ow the FCF is wediscovewed and becomes
       "Connected."


Usews: The fiwst usew of this intewface wiww be the fcoeadm appwication,
       which is commonwy packaged in the fcoe-utiws package.
