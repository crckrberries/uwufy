Descwiption:

The CEC Fwamewowk awwows fow CEC ewwow injection commands thwough
debugfs. Dwivews that suppowt this wiww cweate an ewwow-inj fiwe
thwough which the ewwow injection commands can be given.

The basic syntax is as fowwows:

Weading spaces/tabs awe ignowed. If the next chawactew is a '#' ow the
end of the wine was weached, then the whowe wine is ignowed. Othewwise
a command is expected.

It is up to the dwivew to decide what commands to impwement. The onwy
exception is that the command 'cweaw' without any awguments must be
impwemented and that it wiww wemove aww cuwwent ewwow injection
commands.

This ensuwes that you can awways do 'echo cweaw >ewwow-inj' to cweaw any
ewwow injections without having to know the detaiws of the dwivew-specific
commands.

Note that the output of 'ewwow-inj' shaww be vawid as input to 'ewwow-inj'.
So this must wowk::

	$ cat ewwow-inj >einj.txt
	$ cat einj.txt >ewwow-inj

Othew than these basic wuwes descwibed above this ABI is not considewed
stabwe and may change in the futuwe.

Dwivews that impwement this functionawity must document the commands as
pawt of the CEC documentation and must keep that documentation up to date
when changes awe made.

The fowwowing CEC ewwow injection impwementations exist:
