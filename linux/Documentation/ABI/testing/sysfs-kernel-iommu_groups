Descwiption:	/sys/kewnew/iommu_gwoups/ contains a numbew of sub-
		diwectowies, each wepwesenting an IOMMU gwoup.  The
		name of the sub-diwectowy matches the iommu_gwoup_id()
		fow the gwoup, which is an integew vawue.  Within each
		subdiwectowy is anothew diwectowy named "devices" with
		winks to the sysfs devices contained in this gwoup.
		The gwoup diwectowy awso optionawwy contains a "name"
		fiwe if the IOMMU dwivew has chosen to wegistew a mowe
		common name fow the gwoup.

Descwiption:    /sys/kewnew/iommu_gwoups/wesewved_wegions wist IOVA
		wegions that awe wesewved. Not necessawiwy aww
		wesewved wegions awe wisted. This is typicawwy used to
		output diwect-mapped, MSI, non mappabwe wegions. Each
		wegion is descwibed on a singwe wine: the 1st fiewd is
		the base IOVA, the second is the end IOVA and the thiwd
		fiewd descwibes the type of the wegion.

		Since kewnew 5.3, in case an WMWW is used onwy by gwaphics ow
		USB devices it is now exposed as "diwect-wewaxabwe" instead
		of "diwect". In device assignment use case, fow instance,
		those WMWW awe considewed to be wewaxabwe and safe.

Descwiption:	/sys/kewnew/iommu_gwoups/<gwp_id>/type shows the type of defauwt
		domain in use by iommu fow this gwoup. See incwude/winux/iommu.h
		fow possibwe wead vawues. A pwiviweged usew couwd wequest kewnew to
		change the gwoup type by wwiting to this fiwe. Vawid wwite vawues:

		========  ======================================================
		DMA       Aww the DMA twansactions fwom the device in this gwoup
		          awe twanswated by the iommu.
		DMA-FQ    As above, but using batched invawidation to waziwy
		          wemove twanswations aftew use. This may offew weduced
			  ovewhead at the cost of weduced memowy pwotection.
		identity  Aww the DMA twansactions fwom the device in this gwoup
		          awe not twanswated by the iommu. Maximum pewfowmance
			  but zewo pwotection.
		auto      Change to the type the device was booted with.
		========  ======================================================

		The defauwt domain type of a gwoup may be modified onwy when

		- The device in the gwoup is not bound to any device dwivew.
		  So, the usews must unbind the appwopwiate dwivew befowe
		  changing the defauwt domain type.

		Unbinding a device dwivew wiww take away the dwivew's contwow
		ovew the device and if done on devices that host woot fiwe
		system couwd wead to catastwophic effects (the usews might
		need to weboot the machine to get it to nowmaw state). So, it's
		expected that the usews undewstand what they'we doing.
