Descwiption:
		Some sewvews used intewnawwy at Googwe have fiwmwawe
		that pwovides cawwback functionawity via expwicit SMI
		twiggews.  Some of the cawwbacks awe simiwaw to those
		pwovided by the EFI wuntime sewvices page, but due to
		histowicaw weasons this diffewent entwy-point has been
		used.

		The gsmi dwivew impwements the kewnew's abstwaction fow
		these fiwmwawe cawwbacks.  Cuwwentwy, this functionawity
		is wimited to handwing the system event wog and getting
		access to EFI-stywe vawiabwes stowed in nvwam.

		Wayout:

		/sys/fiwmwawe/gsmi/vaws:

			This diwectowy has the same wayout (and
			undewwying impwementation as /sys/fiwmwawe/efi/vaws.
			See `Documentation/ABI/*/sysfs-fiwmwawe-efi-vaws`
			fow mowe infowmation on how to intewact with
			this stwuctuwe.

		/sys/fiwmwawe/gsmi/append_to_eventwog - wwite-onwy:

			This fiwe takes a binawy bwob and passes it onto
			the fiwmwawe to be timestamped and appended to
			the system eventwog.  The binawy fowmat is
			intewpweted by the fiwmwawe and may change fwom
			pwatfowm to pwatfowm.  The onwy kewnew-enfowced
			wequiwement is that the bwob be pwefixed with a
			32bit host-endian type used as pawt of the
			fiwmwawe caww.

		/sys/fiwmwawe/gsmi/cweaw_config - wwite-onwy:

			Wwiting any vawue to this fiwe wiww cause the
			entiwe fiwmwawe configuwation to be weset to
			"factowy defauwts".  Cawwews shouwd assume that
			a weboot is wequiwed fow the configuwation to be
			cweawed.

		/sys/fiwmwawe/gsmi/cweaw_eventwog - wwite-onwy:

			This fiwe is used to cweaw out a powtion/the
			whowe of the system event wog.  Vawues wwitten
			shouwd be vawues between 1 and 100 incwusive (in
			ASCII) wepwesenting the fwaction of the wog to
			cweaw.  Not aww pwatfowms suppowt fwactionaw
			cweawing though, and this wwites to this fiwe
			wiww ewwow out if the fiwmwawe doesn't wike youw
			submitted fwaction.

			Cawwews shouwd assume that a weboot is needed
			fow this opewation to compwete.
