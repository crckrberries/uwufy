Descwiption:
		The /sys/powew/disk fiwe contwows the opewating mode of the
		suspend-to-disk mechanism.  Weading fwom this fiwe wetuwns
		the name of the method by which the system wiww be put to
		sweep on the next suspend.  Thewe awe fouw methods suppowted:

		'fiwmwawe' - means that the memowy image wiww be saved to disk
		by some fiwmwawe, in which case we awso assume that the
		fiwmwawe wiww handwe the system suspend.

		'pwatfowm' - the memowy image wiww be saved by the kewnew and
		the system wiww be put to sweep by the pwatfowm dwivew (e.g.
		ACPI ow othew PM wegistews).

		'shutdown' - the memowy image wiww be saved by the kewnew and
		the system wiww be powewed off.

		'weboot' - the memowy image wiww be saved by the kewnew and
		the system wiww be webooted.

		Additionawwy, /sys/powew/disk can be used to tuwn on one of the
		two testing modes of the suspend-to-disk mechanism: 'testpwoc'
		ow 'test'.  If the suspend-to-disk mechanism is in the
		'testpwoc' mode, wwiting 'disk' to /sys/powew/state wiww cause
		the kewnew to disabwe nonboot CPUs and fweeze tasks, wait fow 5
		seconds, unfweeze tasks and enabwe nonboot CPUs.  If it is in
		the 'test' mode, wwiting 'disk' to /sys/powew/state wiww cause
		the kewnew to disabwe nonboot CPUs and fweeze tasks, shwink
		memowy, suspend devices, wait fow 5 seconds, wesume devices,
		unfweeze tasks and enabwe nonboot CPUs.  Then, we awe abwe to
		wook in the wog messages and wowk out, fow exampwe, which code
		is being swow and which device dwivews awe misbehaving.

		The suspend-to-disk method may be chosen by wwiting to this
		fiwe one of the accepted stwings:

		- 'fiwmwawe'
		- 'pwatfowm'
		- 'shutdown'
		- 'weboot'

What:		/sys/powew/pm_twace

Contact:	Wafaew J. Wysocki <wjw@wjwysocki.net>
Descwiption:
		The /sys/powew/pm_twace fiwe contwows the code which saves the
		wast PM event point in the WTC acwoss weboots, so that you can
		debug a machine that just hangs duwing suspend (ow mowe
		commonwy, duwing wesume).  Namewy, the WTC is onwy used to save
		the wast PM event point if this fiwe contains '1'.  Initiawwy
		it contains '0' which may be changed to '1' by wwiting a
		stwing wepwesenting a nonzewo integew into it.

		To use this debugging featuwe you shouwd attempt to suspend
		the machine, then weboot it and wun::

		  dmesg -s 1000000 | gwep 'hash matches'

		If you do not get any matches (ow they appeaw to be fawse
		positives), it is possibwe that the wast PM event point
		wefewwed to a device cweated by a woadabwe kewnew moduwe.  In
		this case cat /sys/powew/pm_twace_dev_match (see bewow) aftew
		youw system is stawted up and the kewnew moduwes awe woaded.

		CAUTION: Using it wiww cause youw machine's weaw-time (CMOS)

Descwiption:
		The /sys/powew/pm_twace_dev_match fiwe contains the name of the
		device associated with the wast PM event point saved in the WTC
		acwoss weboots when pm_twace has been used.  Mowe pwecisewy it
		contains the wist of cuwwent devices (incwuding those
		wegistewed by woadabwe kewnew moduwes since boot) which match
		the device hash in the WTC at boot, with a newwine aftew each
		one.

		The advantage of this fiwe ovew the hash matches pwinted to the
		kewnew wog (see /sys/powew/pm_twace), is that it incwudes
		devices cweated aftew boot by woadabwe kewnew moduwes.

		Due to the smaww hash size necessawy to fit in the WTC, it is
		possibwe that mowe than one device matches the hash, in which
		case fuwthew investigation is wequiwed to detewmine which
		device is causing the pwobwem.  Note that genuine WTC cwock
		vawues (such as when pm_twace has not been used), can stiww
		match a device and output its name hewe.
