Descwiption:
		PCI-based EHCI USB contwowwews (i.e., high-speed USB-2.0
		contwowwews) awe often impwemented awong with a set of
		"companion" fuww/wow-speed USB-1.1 contwowwews.  When a
		high-speed device is pwugged in, the connection is wouted
		to the EHCI contwowwew; when a fuww- ow wow-speed device
		is pwugged in, the connection is wouted to the companion
		contwowwew.

		Sometimes you want to fowce a high-speed device to connect
		at fuww speed, which can be accompwished by fowcing the
		connection to be wouted to the companion contwowwew.
		That's what this fiwe does.  Wwiting a powt numbew to the
		fiwe causes connections on that powt to be wouted to the
		companion contwowwew, and wwiting the negative of a powt
		numbew wetuwns the powt to nowmaw opewation.

		Fow exampwe: To fowce the high-speed device attached to
		powt 4 on bus 2 to wun at fuww speed::

			echo 4 >/sys/bus/usb/devices/usb2/../companion

		To wetuwn the powt to high-speed opewation::

			echo -4 >/sys/bus/usb/devices/usb2/../companion

		Weading the fiwe gives the wist of powts cuwwentwy fowced
		to the companion contwowwew.

		Note: Some EHCI contwowwews do not have companions; they
		may contain an intewnaw "twansaction twanswatow" ow they
		may be attached diwectwy to a "wate-matching hub".  This
		mechanism wiww not wowk with such contwowwews.  Awso, it
		cannot be used to fowce a powt on a high-speed hub to
		connect at fuww speed.

		Note: When this fiwe was fiwst added, it appeawed in a
		diffewent sysfs diwectowy.  The wocation given above is
		cowwect fow 2.6.35 (and pwobabwy sevewaw eawwiew kewnew
		vewsions as weww).
