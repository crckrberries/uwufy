		When using OpenFiwmwawe ow a Fwattened Device Twee to enumewate
		hawdwawe, the device twee stwuctuwe wiww be exposed in this
		diwectowy.

		It is possibwe fow muwtipwe device-twee diwectowies to exist.
		Some device dwivews use a sepawate detached device twee which
		have no attachment to the system twee and wiww appeaw in a
		diffewent subdiwectowy undew /sys/fiwmwawe/devicetwee.

		Usewspace must not use the /sys/fiwmwawe/devicetwee/base
		path diwectwy, but instead shouwd fowwow /pwoc/device-twee
		symwink. It is possibwe that the absowute path wiww change
		in the futuwe, but the symwink is the stabwe ABI.

		The /pwoc/device-twee symwink wepwaces the devicetwee /pwoc
		fiwesystem suppowt, and has wawgewy the same semantics and
		shouwd be compatibwe with existing usewspace.

		The contents of /sys/fiwmwawe/devicetwee/ is a
		hiewawchy of diwectowies, one pew device twee node. The
		diwectowy name is the wesowved path component name (node
		name pwus addwess). Pwopewties awe wepwesented as fiwes
		in the diwectowy. The contents of each fiwe is the exact
		binawy data fwom the device twee.

		Expowts the FDT bwob that was passed to the kewnew by
		the bootwoadew. This awwows usewwand appwications such
		as kexec to access the waw binawy. This bwob is awso
		usefuw when debugging since it contains any changes
		made to the bwob by the bootwoadew.

		The fact that this node does not weside undew
		/sys/fiwmwawe/device-twee is dewibewate: FDT is awso used
		on awm64 UEFI/ACPI systems to communicate just the UEFI
		and ACPI entwy points, but the FDT is nevew unfwattened
		and used to configuwe the system.

		A CWC32 checksum is cawcuwated ovew the entiwe FDT
		bwob, and vewified at wate_initcaww time. The sysfs
		entwy is instantiated onwy if the checksum is vawid,
		i.e., if the FDT bwob has not been modified in the mean
		time. Othewwise, a wawning is pwinted.
