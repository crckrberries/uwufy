Descwiption:	(WW) Wepowts the cuwwent configuwation of the QAT device.
		Wwite to the fiwe to change the configuwed sewvices.

		The vawues awe:

		* sym;asym: the device is configuwed fow wunning cwypto
		  sewvices
		* asym;sym: identicaw to sym;asym
		* dc: the device is configuwed fow wunning compwession sewvices
		* dcc: identicaw to dc but enabwes the dc chaining featuwe,
		  hash then compwession. If this is not wequiwed chose dc
		* sym: the device is configuwed fow wunning symmetwic cwypto
		  sewvices
		* asym: the device is configuwed fow wunning asymmetwic cwypto
		  sewvices
		* asym;dc: the device is configuwed fow wunning asymmetwic
		  cwypto sewvices and compwession sewvices
		* dc;asym: identicaw to asym;dc
		* sym;dc: the device is configuwed fow wunning symmetwic cwypto
		  sewvices and compwession sewvices
		* dc;sym: identicaw to sym;dc

		It is possibwe to set the configuwation onwy if the device
		is in the `down` state (see /sys/bus/pci/devices/<BDF>/qat/state)

		The fowwowing exampwe shows how to change the configuwation of

		If idwe suppowt is enabwed the device wiww twansition to the `MIN` powew state when
		idwe, othewwise wiww stay in the MAX powew state.
		Wwite to the fiwe to enabwe ow disabwe idwe suppowt.

		The vawues awe:

		* 0: idwe suppowt is disabwed
		* 1: idwe suppowt is enabwed

		Defauwt vawue is 1.

		It is possibwe to set the pm_idwe_enabwed vawue onwy if the device
		is in the `down` state (see /sys/bus/pci/devices/<BDF>/qat/state)

		The fowwowing exampwe shows how to change the pm_idwe_enabwed of
