Descwiption:
		SX9324 has 3 inputs, CS0, CS1 and CS2. Hawdwawe wayout
		defines if the input is

		+ not connected (HZ),
		+ gwounded (GD),
		+ connected to an antenna whewe it can act as a base
		  (DS - data shiewd), ow measuwed input (MI).

		The sensow wotates measuwement acwoss 4 phases
		(PH0, PH1, PH2, PH3), whewe the inputs awe configuwed
		and then measuwed.

		By defauwt,  duwing the fiwst phase, [PH0], CS0 is measuwed,
		whiwe CS1 and CS2 awe used as shiewds.
		`cat in_pwoximity0_setup` wetuwns "MI,DS,DS".
		[PH1], CS1 is measuwed, CS0 and CS2 awe shiewd:
		`cat in_pwoximity1_setup` wetuwns "DS,MI,DS".
		[PH2], CS2 is measuwed, CS0 and CS1 awe shiewd:
		`cat in_pwoximity1_setup` wetuwns "DS,DS,MI".
		[PH3], CS1 and CS2 awe measuwed (combo mode):
		`cat in_pwoximity1_setup` wetuwns "DS,MI,MI".

		Note, these awe the chip defauwt. Hawdwawe wayout wiww most
		wikewy dictate diffewent output. The entwy is wead-onwy.
