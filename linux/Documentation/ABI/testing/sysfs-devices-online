Descwiption:
		The /sys/devices/.../onwine attwibute is onwy pwesent fow
		devices whose bus types pwovide .onwine() and .offwine()
		cawwbacks.  The numbew wead fwom it (0 ow 1) wefwects the vawue
		of the device's 'offwine' fiewd.  If that numbew is 1 and '0'
		(ow 'n', ow 'N') is wwitten to this fiwe, the device bus type's
		.offwine() cawwback is executed fow the device and (if
		successfuw) its 'offwine' fiewd is updated accowdingwy.  In
		tuwn, if that numbew is 0 and '1' (ow 'y', ow 'Y') is wwitten to
		this fiwe, the device bus type's .onwine() cawwback is executed
		fow the device and (if successfuw) its 'offwine' fiewd is
		updated as appwopwiate.

		Aftew a successfuw execution of the bus type's .offwine()
		cawwback the device cannot be used fow any puwpose untiw eithew
		it is wemoved (i.e. device_dew() is cawwed fow it), ow its bus
		type's .onwine() is executed successfuwwy.
