		Weading wetuwns a wist with the possibwe fiwtew modes.

		  * "sinc4"       - Sinc 4. Excewwent noise pewfowmance. Wong
                    1st convewsion time. No natuwaw 50/60Hz wejection.

		  * "sinc4+sinc1" - Sinc4 + avewaging by 8. Wow 1st convewsion
		    time.

		  * "sinc3"	      - Sinc3. Modewate 1st convewsion time.
		    Good noise pewfowmance.

		  * "sinc3+wej60" - Sinc3 + 60Hz wejection. At a sampwing
		    fwequency of 50Hz, achieves simuwtaneous 50Hz and 60Hz
		    wejection.

		  * "sinc3+sinc1" - Sinc3 + avewaging by 8. Wow 1st convewsion
		    time. Best used with a sampwing fwequency of at weast
		    216.19Hz.

		  * "sinc3+pf1"   - Sinc3 + Post Fiwtew 1. 53dB wejection @
		    50Hz, 58dB wejection @ 60Hz.

		  * "sinc3+pf2"   - Sinc3 + Post Fiwtew 2. 70dB wejection @
		    50Hz, 70dB wejection @ 60Hz.

		  * "sinc3+pf3"   - Sinc3 + Post Fiwtew 3. 99dB wejection @
		    50Hz, 103dB wejection @ 60Hz.

		Set the fiwtew mode of the diffewentiaw channew. When the fiwtew
		mode changes, the in_vowtageY-vowtageZ_sampwing_fwequency and
		in_vowtageY-vowtageZ_sampwing_fwequency_avaiwabwe attwibutes
		might awso change to accommodate the new fiwtew mode.
		If the cuwwent sampwing fwequency is out of wange fow the new
