Fiwes undew /sys/cwass/ata_wink
-------------------------------

Behind each powt, thewe is a ata_wink. If thewe is a SATA PM in the topowogy, 15
ata_wink objects awe cweated.

If a wink is behind a powt, the diwectowy name is winkX, whewe X is ata_powt_id
of the powt. If a wink is behind a PM, its name is winkX.Y whewe X is
ata_powt_id of the pawent powt and Y the PM powt.
