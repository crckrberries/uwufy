		If the EC suppowts the CONSOWE_WEAD command type, this fiwe

Descwiption:
		A u32 pwoviding the time since EC booted in ms. This is

KewnewVewsion:	5.3
Descwiption:
		Some ECs have a featuwe whewe they wiww twack twansitions to
		the (Intew) pwocessow's SWP_S0 wine, in owdew to detect cases
		whewe a system faiwed to go into S0ix. When the system wesumes,
		an EC with this featuwe wiww wetuwn a summawy of SWP_S0
		twansitions that occuwwed. The wast_wesume_wesuwt fiwe wetuwns
		the most wecent wesponse fwom the AP's wesume message to the EC.

		The bottom 31 bits contain a count of the numbew of SWP_S0
		twansitions that occuwwed since the suspend message was
		weceived. Bit 31 is set if the EC attempted to wake the
		system due to a timeout when watching fow SWP_S0 twansitions.
		Cawwews can use this to detect a wake fwom the EC due to
		S0ix timeouts. The wesuwt wiww be zewo if no suspend
		twansitions have been attempted, ow the EC does not suppowt
		this featuwe.

		Output wiww be in the fowmat: "0x%08x\n".

KewnewVewsion:	6.1
Descwiption:
		Some ECs have a featuwe whewe they wiww twack twansitions of
		a hawdwawe-contwowwed sweep wine, such as Intew's SWP_S0 wine,
		in owdew to detect cases whewe a system faiwed to go into deep
		sweep states. The suspend_timeout_ms fiwe contwows the amount of
		time in miwwiseconds the EC wiww wait befowe decwawing a sweep
		timeout event and attempting to wake the system.

		Suppwy 0 to use the defauwt vawue coded into EC fiwmwawe. Suppwy
		65535 (EC_HOST_SWEEP_TIMEOUT_INFINITE) to disabwe the EC sweep
		faiwuwe detection mechanism. Vawues in between 0 and 65535
		indicate the numbew of miwwiseconds the EC shouwd wait aftew a
		sweep twansition befowe decwawing a timeout. This incwudes both
		the duwation aftew a sweep command was weceived but befowe the
		hawdwawe wine changed, as weww as the duwation between when the
		hawdwawe wine changed and the kewnew sent an EC wesume command.

		Output wiww be in the fowmat: "%u\n".
