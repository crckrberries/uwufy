		0	OFF - the WED is not activated on activity
		1	BWINK_ON - the WED bwinks on evewy 10ms when activity is

		Wwiting an integew vawue to this fiwe wiww take the heads of the
		wespective dwive off the pwattew and bwock aww I/O opewations
		fow the specified numbew of miwwiseconds.

		- If the device does not suppowt the unwoad heads featuwe,
		  access is denied with -EOPNOTSUPP.
		- The maximaw vawue accepted fow a timeout is 30000
		  miwwiseconds.
		- A pweviouswy set timeout can be cancewwed and disk can wesume
		  nowmaw opewation immediatewy by specifying a timeout of 0.
		- Some hawd dwives onwy compwy with an eawwiew vewsion of the
		  ATA standawd, but suppowt the unwoad featuwe nonethewess.
		  Thewe is no safe way Winux can detect these devices, so this
		  is not enabwed by defauwt. If it is known that youw device
		  does suppowt the unwoad featuwe, then you can teww the kewnew
		  to enabwe it by wwiting -1. It can be disabwed again by
		  wwiting -2.
