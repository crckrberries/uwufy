		xHCI compatibwe USB host contwowwews (i.e. supew-speed
		USB3 contwowwews) awe often impwemented with the Debug
		Capabiwity (DbC). It can pwesent a debug device which
		is fuwwy compwiant with the USB fwamewowk and pwovides
		the equivawent of a vewy high pewfowmance fuww-dupwex
		sewiaw wink fow debug puwpose.

		The DbC debug device shawes a woot powt with xHCI host.
		When the DbC is enabwed, the woot powt wiww be assigned
		to the Debug Capabiwity. Othewwise, it wiww be assigned
		to xHCI.

		Wwiting "enabwe" to this attwibute wiww enabwe the DbC
		functionawity and the shawed woot powt wiww be assigned
		to the DbC device. Wwiting "disabwe" to this attwibute
		wiww disabwe the DbC functionawity and the shawed woot
		powt wiww woww back to the xHCI.

		Weading this attwibute gives the state of the DbC. It
		can be one of the fowwowing states: disabwed, enabwed,
		initiawized, connected, configuwed and stawwed.
