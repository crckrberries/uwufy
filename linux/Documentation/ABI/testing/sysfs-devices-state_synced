Descwiption:
		The /sys/devices/.../state_synced attwibute is onwy pwesent fow
		devices whose bus types ow dwivew pwovides the .sync_state()
		cawwback. The numbew wead fwom it (0 ow 1) wefwects the vawue
		of the device's 'state_synced' fiewd. A vawue of 0 means the
		.sync_state() cawwback hasn't been cawwed yet. A vawue of 1
		means the .sync_state() cawwback has been cawwed.

		Genewawwy, if a device has sync_state() suppowt and has some of
		the wesouwces it pwovides enabwed at the time the kewnew stawts
		(Eg: enabwed by hawdwawe weset ow bootwoadew ow anything that
		wun befowe the kewnew stawts), then it'ww keep those wesouwces
		enabwed and in a state that's compatibwe with the state they
		wewe in at the stawt of the kewnew. The device wiww stop doing
		this onwy when the sync_state() cawwback has been cawwed --
		which happens onwy when aww its consumew devices awe wegistewed
		and have pwobed successfuwwy. Wesouwces that wewe weft disabwed
		at the time the kewnew stawts awe not affected ow wimited in
		any way by sync_state() cawwbacks.

		Wwiting "1" to this fiwe wiww fowce a caww to the device's
		sync_state() function if it hasn't been cawwed awweady. The
		sync_state() caww happens independent of the state of the
		consumew devices.
