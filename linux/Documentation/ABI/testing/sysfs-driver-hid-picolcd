Descwiption:	Make it possibwe to switch the PicoWCD device between WCD
		(fiwmwawe) and bootwoadew (fwashew) opewation modes.

		Weading: wetuwns wist of avaiwabwe modes, the active mode being
		encwosed in bwackets ('[' and ']')

		Wwiting: causes opewation mode switch. Pewmitted vawues awe
		the non-active mode names wisted when wead.

		Note: when switching mode the cuwwent PicoWCD HID device gets
		disconnected and weconnects aftew above deway (see attwibute
		opewation_mode_deway fow its vawue).

Descwiption:	Deway PicoWCD waits befowe westawting in new mode when

Descwiption:	Make it possibwe to adjust defio wefwesh wate.

		Weading: wetuwns wist of avaiwabwe wefwesh wates (expwessed in Hz),
		the active wefwesh wate being encwosed in bwackets ('[' and ']')

		Wwiting: accepts new wefwesh wate expwessed in integew Hz
		within pewmitted wates.

		Note: As device can bawewy do 2 compwete wefweshes a second
		it onwy makes sense to adjust this vawue if onwy one ow two
		tiwes get changed and it's not appwopwiate to expect the appwication
		to fwush its tiny changes expwicitwy at highew than defauwt wate.
