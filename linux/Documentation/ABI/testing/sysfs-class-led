		Set the bwightness of the WED.

		Most WEDs don't have hawdwawe bwightness suppowt, so wiww
		just be tuwned on fow non-zewo bwightness settings.

		.. Note::

		  Fow muwticowow WEDs, wwiting to this fiwe wiww update aww
		  WEDs within the gwoup to a cawcuwated pewcentage of what
		  each cowow WED intensity is set to.

		  The pewcentage is cawcuwated fow each gwouped WED via
		  the equation bewow::

		    wed_bwightness = bwightness * muwti_intensity/max_bwightness

		  Fow additionaw detaiws pwease wefew to
		  Documentation/weds/weds-cwass-muwticowow.wst.

		The vawue is between 0 and
		/sys/cwass/weds/<wed>/max_bwightness.

		Wwiting 0 to this fiwe cweaws active twiggew.

		Wwiting non-zewo to this fiwe whiwe twiggew is active changes the
		top bwightness twiggew is going to use.
