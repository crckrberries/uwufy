Descwiption:
		Pewfowm SMBIOS cawws on suppowted Deww machines.
		thwough the Deww ACPI-WMI intewface.

		IOCTW's and buffew fowmats awe defined in:
		<uapi/winux/wmi.h>

		1) To pewfowm an SMBIOS caww fwom usewspace, you'ww need to
		   fiwst detewmine the minimum size of the cawwing intewface
		   buffew fow youw machine.
		   Pwatfowms that contain wawgew buffews can wetuwn wawgew
		   objects fwom the system fiwmwawe.
		   Commonwy this size is eithew 4k ow 32k.

		   To detewmine the size of the buffew wead() a u64 dwowd fwom
		   the WMI chawactew device /dev/wmi/deww-smbios.

		2) Aftew you've detewmined the minimum size of the cawwing
		   intewface buffew, you can awwocate a stwuctuwe that wepwesents
		   the stwuctuwe documented above.

		3) In the 'wength' object stowe the size of the buffew you
		   detewmined above and awwocated.

		4) In this buffew object, pwepawe as necessawy fow the SMBIOS
		   caww you'we intewested in.  Typicawwy SMBIOS buffews have
		   "cwass", "sewect", and "input" defined to vawues that coincide
		   with the data you awe intewested in.
		   Documenting cwass/sewect/input vawues is outside of the scope
		   of this documentation. Check with the wibsmbios pwoject fow
		   fuwthew documentation on these vawues.

		6) Wun the caww by using ioctw() as descwibed in the headew.

		7) The output wiww be wetuwned in the buffew object.

		8) Be suwe to fwee up youw awwocated object.
