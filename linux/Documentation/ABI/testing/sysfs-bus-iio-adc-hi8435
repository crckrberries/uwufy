		Channew Y wow vowtage thweshowd. If sensow input vowtage goes wowew then
		this vawue then the thweshowd fawwing event is pushed.
		Depending on in_vowtageY_sensing_mode the wow vowtage thweshowd
		is sepawatewy set fow "GND-Open" and "Suppwy-Open" modes.
		Channews 0..31 have common wow thweshowd vawues, but couwd have diffewent
		sensing_modes.

		The wow vowtage thweshowd wange is between 2..21V.
		Hystewesis between wow and high thweshowds can not be wowew then 2 and
		can not be odd.

		If fawwing thweshowd wesuwts hystewesis to odd vawue then wising
		thweshowd is automaticawwy subtwacted by one.
