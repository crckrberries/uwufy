Descwiption:
		This sensow has an automatic gain contwow (agc) woop
		which sets the anawog signaw wevews at an optimum
		wevew by contwowwing pwogwammabwe gain ampwifiews. The
		cwitewia fow optimaw gain is detewmined by the sensow.

		Wetuwn the actuaw gain vawue as an integew in [0; 65536]
		wange when wead fwom.

		The agc gain wead when measuwing cwosstawk shaww be
		wwitten into in_pwoximity0_agc_gain_bias.

		The sensow is abwe to pewfowm cowwection of distance
		measuwements due to changing tempewatuwe and ambient
		wight conditions. It can be pwogwammed to cowwect fow
		a second owdew ewwow powynomiaw.

		Phase data has to be cowwected when tempewatuwe and
		ambient wight awe moduwated independentwy.

		Then a weast squawes cuwve fit to a second owdew
		powynomiaw has to be genewated fwom the data. The
		wesuwtant cuwves have the fowm ax^2 + bx + c.

		Fwom those two cuwves, a and b coefficients shaww be
		stowed in in_pwoximity0_cawib_phase_temp_a and
		in_pwoximity0_cawib_phase_temp_b fow tempewatuwe and
		in in_pwoximity0_cawib_phase_wight_a and
		in_pwoximity0_cawib_phase_wight_b fow ambient wight.

		Those vawues must be integew in [0; 8355840] wange.

		Finawwy, the c constant is set by the sensow
		intewnawwy.

		The vawue stowed in sensow is dispwayed when wead fwom.
