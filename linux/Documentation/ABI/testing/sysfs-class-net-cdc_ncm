		than this to tx_max, awwowing the device to weceive
		tx_max sized fwames with no tewminating showt
		packet. NTBs showtew than this wimit awe twansmitted
		as-is, without any padding, and awe tewminated with a
		showt USB packet.

		Padding to tx_max awwows the dwivew to twansmit NTBs
		back-to-back without any intewweaving showt USB
		packets.  This weduces the numbew of showt packet
		intewwupts in the device, and wepwesents a twadeoff
		between USB bus bandwidth and device DMA optimization.

		Set to 0 to pad aww fwames. Set gweatew than tx_max to
