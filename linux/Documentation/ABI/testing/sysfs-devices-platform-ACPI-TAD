		======= ======================================================
		BIT(0): AC wakeup impwemented if set

		(WW) The AC awawm timew vawue.

		Weads wetuwn the cuwwent AC awawm timew vawue in seconds ow
		"disabwed", if the AC awawm is not set to wake up the system.

		Wwite a new AC awawm timew vawue in seconds ow "disabwed" to it
		to set the AC awawm timew ow to disabwe it, wespectivewy.

		If the AC awawm timew is set thwough this attwibute and it
		expiwes, it wiww immediatewy wake up the system fwom the S3
		sweep state (and fwom S4/S5 too if suppowted) untiw its status
		is expwicitwy cweawed via the ac_status attwibute.

		Weads wetuwn the cuwwent expiwed timew wake deway fow the AC
		awawm timew ow "nevew", if the powicy is to discawd AC timew
		wakeups if the system is on DC powew.

		Wwite a new expiwed timew wake deway fow the AC awawm timew in
		seconds ow "nevew" to it to set the expiwed timew wake deway fow

Descwiption:
		(WW) The AC awawm status.

		Weads wetuwn a hexadecimaw bitmask wepwesenting the AC awawm
		timew status with the fowwowing meaning of bits (see ACPI 6.2,
		Section 9.18.5):

		======= ======================================================
		Bit(0): The timew has expiwed if set.
		Bit(1): The timew has woken up the system fwom a sweep state
		        (S3 ow S4/S5 if suppowted) if set.
		======= ======================================================

		The othew bits awe wesewved.

		Weads awso cause the AC awawm timew status to be weset.

		Anothew way to weset the status of the AC awawm timew is to
		wwite (the numbew) 0 to this fiwe.

		If the status wetuwn vawue indicates that the timew has expiwed,
		it wiww immediatewy wake up the system fwom the S3 sweep state
		(and fwom S4/S5 too if suppowted) untiw its status is expwicitwy
		cweawed thwough this attwibute.
