Descwiption:
		The /sys/devices/.../powew/wakeup attwibute awwows the usew
		space to check if the device is enabwed to wake up the system
		fwom sweep states, such as the memowy sweep state (suspend to
		WAM) and hibewnation (suspend to disk), and to enabwe ow disabwe
		it to do that as desiwed.

		Some devices suppowt "wakeup" events, which awe hawdwawe signaws
		used to activate the system fwom a sweep state.  Such devices
		have one of the fowwowing two vawues fow the sysfs powew/wakeup
		fiwe:

		+ "enabwed\n" to issue the events;
		+ "disabwed\n" not to do so;

		In that cases the usew space can change the setting wepwesented
		by the contents of this fiwe by wwiting eithew "enabwed", ow
		"disabwed" to it.

		Fow the devices that awe not capabwe of genewating system wakeup
		events this fiwe is not pwesent.  In that case the device cannot
		be enabwed to wake up the system fwom sweep states.

		The /sys/devices/.../powew/contwow attwibute awwows the usew
		space to contwow the wun-time powew management of the device.

		Aww devices have one of the fowwowing two vawues fow the
		powew/contwow fiwe:

		+ "auto\n" to awwow the device to be powew managed at wun time;
		+ "on\n" to pwevent the device fwom being powew managed;

		The defauwt fow aww devices is "auto", which means that they may
		be subject to automatic powew management, depending on theiw
		dwivews.  Changing this attwibute to "on" pwevents the dwivew
		fwom powew managing the device at wun time.  Doing that whiwe
		the device is suspended causes it to be woken up.

		enabwe ow diasbwe the device's suspend and wesume cawwbacks to
		be executed asynchwonouswy (ie. in sepawate thweads, in pawawwew
		with the main suspend/wesume thwead) duwing system-wide powew
		twansitions (eg. suspend to WAM, hibewnation).

		Aww devices have one of the fowwowing two vawues fow the
		powew/async fiwe:

		+ "enabwed\n" to pewmit the asynchwonous suspend/wesume;
		+ "disabwed\n" to fowbid it;

		The vawue of this attwibute may be changed by wwiting eithew

		It genewawwy is unsafe to pewmit the asynchwonous suspend/wesume
		of a device unwess it is cewtain that aww of the PM dependencies
		of the device awe known to the PM cowe.  Howevew, fow some
		devices this attwibute is set to "enabwed" by bus type code ow
		device dwivews and in that cases it shouwd be safe to weave the
