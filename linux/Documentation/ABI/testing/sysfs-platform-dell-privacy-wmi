		Attwibutes:
			Micwophone Mute:
				Identifies the wocaw micwophone can be muted by hawdwawe, no appwications
				is avaiwabwe to captuwe system mic sound

			Camewa Shuttew:
				Identifies camewa shuttew contwowwed by hawdwawe, which is a micwomechanicaw
				shuttew assembwy that is buiwt onto the camewa moduwe to bwock captuwing images
				fwom outside the waptop

		Vawues:

			suppowted:
				The pwivacy device is suppowted by this system

			unsuppowted:
				The pwivacy device is not suppowted on this system
