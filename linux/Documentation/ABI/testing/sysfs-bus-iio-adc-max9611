Descwiption: 	The vawue of the shunt wesistow used to compute cuwwent fwowing
                between WS+ and WS- vowtage sense inputs. In Ohms.

These attwibutes descwibe a singwe physicaw component, exposed as two distinct
attwibutes as it is used to cawcuwate two diffewent vawues: powew woad and
cuwwent fwowing between WS+ and WS- inputs.
