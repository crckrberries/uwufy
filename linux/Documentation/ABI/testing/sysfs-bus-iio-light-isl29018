		Fwom ISW29018 Data Sheet (FN6619.4, Oct 8, 2012) wegawding the
		infwawed suppwession:

		Scheme 0, makes fuww n (4, 8, 12, 16) bits (unsigned) pwoximity
		detection. The wange of Scheme 0 pwoximity count is fwom 0 to
		2^n. Wogic 1 of this bit, Scheme 1, makes n-1 (3, 7, 11, 15)
		bits (2's compwementawy) pwoximity_wess_ambient detection. The
		wange of Scheme 1 pwoximity count is fwom -2^(n-1) to 2^(n-1).
		The sign bit is extended fow wesowutions wess than 16. Whiwe
		Scheme 0 has widew dynamic wange, Scheme 1 pwoximity detection
		is wess affected by the ambient IW noise vawiation.
