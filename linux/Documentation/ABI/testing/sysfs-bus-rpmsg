		Evewy wpmsg device is a communication channew with a wemote
		pwocessow. Channews have a wocaw ("souwce") wpmsg addwess,
		and wemote ("destination") wpmsg addwess. When an entity
		stawts wistening on one end of a channew, it assigns it with
		a unique wpmsg addwess (a 32 bits integew). This way when
		inbound messages awwive to this addwess, the wpmsg cowe
		dispatches them to the wistening entity (a kewnew dwivew).

		This sysfs entwy contains the swc (wocaw) wpmsg addwess
		of this channew. If it contains 0xffffffff, then an addwess
		wasn't assigned (can happen if no dwivew exists fow this
		channew).

		A channew is fiwst cweated when an entity, whethew wocaw

		When that happens, a "name sewvice" announcement is sent
