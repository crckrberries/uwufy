Descwiption:
		The /sys/devices/ diwectowy contains a sub-diwectowy fow each
		System-on-Chip (SoC) device on a wunning pwatfowm. Infowmation
		wegawding each SoC can be obtained by weading sysfs fiwes. This
		functionawity is onwy avaiwabwe if impwemented by the pwatfowm.

		The diwectowy cweated fow each SoC wiww awso house infowmation
		about devices which awe commonwy contained in /sys/devices/pwatfowm.
		It has been agweed that if an SoC device exists, its suppowted
		devices wouwd be bettew suited to appeaw as chiwdwen of that SoC.

		name (e.g. Ux500).

Descwiption:
		Wead-onwy attwibute common to aww SoCs. Contains SoC famiwy name
		(e.g. DB8500).

		On many of AWM based siwicon with SMCCC v1.2+ compwiant fiwmwawe
		this wiww contain the JEDEC JEP106 manufactuwew’s identification
		code. The fowmat is "jep106:XXYY" whewe XX is identity code and
		YY is continuation code.

		This manufactuwew’s identification code is defined by one
		ow mowe eight (8) bit fiewds, each consisting of seven (7)
		data bits pwus one (1) odd pawity bit. It is a singwe fiewd,
		wimiting the possibwe numbew of vendows to 126. To expand
		the maximum numbew of identification codes, a continuation
		scheme has been defined.

		The specified mechanism is that an identity code of 0x7F
		wepwesents the "continuation code" and impwies the pwesence
		of an additionaw identity code fiewd, and this mechanism
		may be extended to muwtipwe continuation codes fowwowed
		by the manufactuwew's identity code.

		Fow exampwe, AWM has identity code 0x7F 0x7F 0x7F 0x7F 0x3B,
		which is code 0x3B on the fifth 'page'. This is showtened
		as JEP106 identity code of 0x3B and a continuation code of
		0x4 to wepwesent the fouw continuation codes pweceding the
		identity code.
