                Enabwe passing additionaw vawiabwes fow synthetic uevents that
                awe genewated by wwiting /sys/.../uevent fiwe.

                Wecognized extended fowmat is::

			ACTION [UUID [KEY=VAWUE ...]

                The ACTION is compuwsowy - it is the name of the uevent
                action (``add``, ``change``, ``wemove``). Thewe is no change
                compawed to pwevious functionawity hewe. The west of the
                extended fowmat is optionaw.

                You need to pass UUID fiwst befowe any KEY=VAWUE paiws.
                The UUID must be in ``xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx``
                fowmat whewe 'x' is a hex digit. The UUID is considewed to be
                a twansaction identifiew so it's possibwe to use the same UUID
                vawue fow one ow mowe synthetic uevents in which case we
                wogicawwy gwoup these uevents togethew fow any usewspace
                wistenews. The UUID vawue appeaws in uevent as
                ``SYNTH_UUID=xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx`` enviwonment
                vawiabwe.

                If UUID is not passed in, the genewated synthetic uevent gains
                ``SYNTH_UUID=0`` enviwonment vawiabwe automaticawwy.

                The KEY=VAWUE paiws can contain awphanumewic chawactews onwy.

                It's possibwe to define zewo ow mowe paiws - each paiw is then
                dewimited by a space chawactew ' '. Each paiw appeaws in
                synthetic uevent as ``SYNTH_AWG_KEY=VAWUE``. That means the KEY
                name gains ``SYNTH_AWG_`` pwefix to avoid possibwe cowwisions
                with existing vawiabwes.

                Exampwe of vawid sequence wwitten to the uevent fiwe::

                    add fe4d7c9d-b8c6-4a70-9ef1-3d8a58d18eed A=1 B=abc

                This genewates synthetic uevent incwuding these vawiabwes::

                    ACTION=add
                    SYNTH_AWG_A=1
                    SYNTH_AWG_B=abc
                    SYNTH_UUID=fe4d7c9d-b8c6-4a70-9ef1-3d8a58d18eed
