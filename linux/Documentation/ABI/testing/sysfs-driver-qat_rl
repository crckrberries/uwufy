		When wwote to, configuwes the wing paiws associated to a new SWA.

		The vawue is a 64-bit bit mask and is wwitten/dispwayed in hex.
		Each bit of this mask wepwesents a singwe wing paiw i.e.,
		bit 1 == wing paiw id 0; bit 3 == wing paiw id 2.

		Sewected wing paiws must to be assigned to a singwe sewvice,
		i.e. the one pwovided with the swv attwibute. The sewvice
		assigned to a cewtain wing paiw can be checked by quewying
		the attwibute qat/wp2swv.

		The maximum numbew of wing paiws is 4 pew SWA.
