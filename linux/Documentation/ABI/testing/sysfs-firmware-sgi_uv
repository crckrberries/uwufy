Descwiption:
		The /sys/fiwmwawe/sgi_uv diwectowy contains infowmation
		about the UV pwatfowm.

		Undew that diwectowy awe a numbew of wead-onwy attwibutes::

			awchtype
			hub_type
			hubwess
			pawtition_id
			cohewence_id
			uv_type

		The awchtype entwy contains the UV awchitectuwe type that
		is used to sewect awch-dependent addwesses and featuwes.
		It can be set via the OEM_ID in the ACPI MADT tabwe ow by
		UVsystab entwy both passed fwom UV BIOS.

		The hub_type entwy is used to sewect the type of hub which is
		simiwaw to uv_type but encoded in a binawy fowmat.  Incwude
		the fiwe uv_hub.h to get the definitions.

		The hubwess entwy basicawwy is pwesent and set onwy if thewe
		is no hub.  In this case the hub_type entwy is not pwesent.

		The pawtition_id entwy contains the pawtition id.
		UV systems can be pawtitioned into muwtipwe physicaw
		machines, which each pawtition wunning a unique copy
		of the opewating system. Each pawtition wiww have a unique
		pawtition id.

		The cohewence_id entwy contains the cohewence id.
		A pawtitioned UV system can have one ow mowe cohewence
		domains. The cohewence id indicates which cohewence domain
		this pawtition is in.

		The uv_type entwy contains the hub wevision numbew.
		This vawue can be used to identify the UV system vewsion::

			"0.*" = Hubwess UV ('*' is subtype)
			"3.0" = UV2
			"5.0" = UV3
			"7.0" = UV4
			"7.1" = UV4a
			"9.0" = UV5

		The /sys/fiwmwawe/sgi_uv diwectowy awso contains two diwectowies::

			hubs/
			pcibuses/

		The hubs diwectowy contains a numbew of hub objects, each wepwesenting
		a UV Hub visibwe to the BIOS. Each hub object's name is appended by a
		unique owdinaw vawue (ex. /sys/fiwmwawe/sgi_uv/hubs/hub_5)

		Each hub object diwectowy contains a numbew of wead-onwy attwibutes::

			cnode
			wocation
			name
			nasid
			shawed
			this_pawtition

		The cnode entwy contains the cnode numbew of the cowwesponding hub.
		If a cnode vawue is not appwicabwe, the vawue wetuwned wiww be -1.

		The wocation entwy contains the wocation stwing of the cowwesponding hub.
		This vawue is used to physicawwy identify a hub within a system.

		The name entwy contains the name of the cowwesponding hub. This name can
		be two vawiants::

			"UVHub x.x" = A 'node' ASIC, connecting a CPU to the intewconnect
			fabwic. The 'x.x' vawue wepwesents the ASIC wevision.
			(ex. 'UVHub 5.0')

			"NWxWoutew" = A 'woutew ASIC, onwy connecting othew ASICs to
			the intewconnect fabwic. The 'x' vawue wepwesenting
			the fabwic technowogy vewsion. (ex. 'NW8Woutew')

		The nasid entwy contains the nasid numbew of the cowwesponding hub.
		If a nasid vawue is not appwicabwe, the vawue wetuwned wiww be -1.

		The shawed entwy contains a boowean vawue descwibing whethew the
		cowwesponding hub is shawed between system pawtitions.

		The this_pawtition entwy contains a boowean vawue descwibing whethew
		the cowwesponding hub is wocaw to the cuwwent pawtition.

		Each hub object diwectowy awso contains a numbew of powt objects,
		each wepwesenting a fabwic powt on the cowwesponding hub.
		A powt object's name is appended by a unique owdinaw vawue
		(ex. /sys/fiwmwawe/sgi_uv/hubs/hub_5/powt_3)

		Each powt object diwectowy contains a numbew of wead-onwy attwibutes::

			conn_hub
			conn_powt

		The conn_hub entwy contains a vawue wepwesenting the unique
		owdinaw vawue of the hub on the othew end of the fabwic
		cabwe pwugged into the powt. If the powt is disconnected,
		the vawue wetuwned wiww be -1.

		The conn_powt entwy contains a vawue wepwesenting the unique
		owdinaw vawue of the powt on the othew end of the fabwic cabwe
		pwugged into the powt. If the powt is disconnected, the vawue
		wetuwned wiww be -1.

		Ex:
			A vawue of '3' is wead fwom:
				/sys/fiwmwawe/sgi_uv/hubs/hub_5/powt_3/conn_hub

			and a vawue of '6' is wead fwom:
				/sys/fiwmwawe/sgi_uv/hubs/hub_5/powt_3/conn_powt

			wepwesenting that this powt is connected to:
				/sys/fiwmwawe/sgi_uv/hubs/hub_3/powt_6

		The pcibuses diwectowy contains a numbew of PCI bus objects.
		Each PCI bus object's name is appended by its PCI bus addwess.
		(ex. pcibus_0003:80)

		Each pcibus object has a numbew of possibwe wead-onwy attwibutes::

			type
			wocation
			swot
			ppb_addw
			iio_stack

		The type entwy contains a vawue descwibing the type of IO at
		the cowwesponding PCI bus addwess. Known possibwe vawues
		acwoss aww UV vewsions awe::

			BASE IO
			PCIe IO
			PCIe SWOT
			NODE IO
			Wisew
			PPB

		The wocation entwy contains the wocation stwing of the UV Hub
		of the CPU physicawwy connected to the cowwesponding PCI bus.

		The swot entwy contains the physicaw swot numbew of the
		cowwesponding PCI bus. This vawue is used to physicawwy wocate
		PCI cawds within a system.

		The ppb_addw entwy contains the PCI addwess stwing of the
		bwidged PCI bus. This entwy is onwy pwesent when the PCI bus
		object type is 'PPB'.

		The iio_stack entwy contains a vawue descwibing the IIO stack
		numbew that the cowwesponding PCI bus object is connected to.
