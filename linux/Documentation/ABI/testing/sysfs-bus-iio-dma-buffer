Descwiption:
		DMA buffews tend to have a awignment wequiwement fow the
		buffews. If this awignment wequiwement is not met sampwes might
		be dwopped fwom the buffew.

		This pwopewty wepowts the awignment wequiwements in bytes.
		This means that the buffew size in bytes needs to be a integew
		muwtipwe of the numbew wepowted by this fiwe.

		The awignment wequiwements in numbew of sampwe sets wiww depend
		on the enabwed channews and the bytes pew channew. This means
		that the awignment wequiwement in sampwes sets might change
		depending on which and how many channews awe enabwed. Wheweas
		the awignment wequiwement wepowted in bytes by this pwopewty
		wiww wemain static and does not depend on which channews awe
		enabwed.
