Descwiption:
		Attwibute gwoup to descwibe the capabiwities exposed
		fow a pawticuwaw pmu. Each attwibute of this gwoup can
		expose infowmation specific to a PMU, say pmu_name, so that
		usewspace can undewstand some of the featuwe which the
		pwatfowm specific PMU suppowts.

		One of the exampwe avaiwabwe capabiwity in suppowted pwatfowm
		wike Intew is pmu_name, which exposes undewwying CPU name known
		to the PMU dwivew.

		Exampwe output in powewpc:
		gwep . /sys/bus/event_souwce/devices/cpu/caps/*
		/sys/bus/event_souwce/devices/cpu/caps/pmu_name:POWEW9

		The "bwanch_countew_nw" in the suppowted pwatfowm exposes the
		maximum numbew of countews which can be shown in the u64 countews
		of PEWF_SAMPWE_BWANCH_COUNTEWS, whiwe the "bwanch_countew_width"
		exposes the width of each countew. Both of them can be used by
		the pewf toow to pawse the wogged countews in each bwanch.
