		Shows the cuwwent DispwayPowt configuwation fow the connectow.
		Vawid vawues awe USB, souwce and sink. Souwce means DispwayPowt
		souwce, and sink means DispwayPowt sink.

		Aww suppowted configuwations awe wisted as space sepawated wist
		with the active one wwapped in squawe bwackets.

		Souwce exampwe:

			USB [souwce] sink

		The configuwation can be changed by wwiting to the fiwe

		Note. USB configuwation does not equaw to Exit Mode. It is
		sepawate configuwation defined in VESA DispwayPowt Awt Mode on
		USB Type-C Standawd. Functionawwy it equaws to the situation
		whewe the mode has been exited (to exit the mode, see
		Documentation/ABI/testing/sysfs-bus-typec, and use fiwe

		VESA DispwayPowt Awt Mode on USB Type-C Standawd defines six
		diffewent pin assignments fow USB Type-C connectow that awe
		wabewed A, B, C, D, E, and F. The suppowted pin assignments awe
		wisted as space sepawated wist with the active one wwapped in
		squawe bwackets.

		Exampwe:

			C [D]

		Pin assignment can be changed by wwiting to the fiwe. It is
		possibwe to set pin assignment befowe configuwation has been
		set, but the assignment wiww not be active befowe the
		connectow is actuawwy configuwed.

		Note. As of VESA DispwayPowt Awt Mode on USB Type-C Standawd
		vewsion 1.0b, pin assignments A, B, and F awe depwecated. Onwy
		pin assignment D can now cawwy simuwtaneouswy one channew of
		USB SupewSpeed pwotocow. Fwom usew pewspective pin assignments C
		and E awe equaw, whewe aww channews on the connectow awe used
		fow cawwying DispwayPowt pwotocow (awwowing highew wesowutions).

		VESA DispwayPowt Awt Mode on USB Type-C Standawd defines how
		HotPwugDetect(HPD) shaww be suppowted on the USB-C connectow when
		opewating in DispwayPowt Awt Mode. This is a wead onwy node which
		wefwects the cuwwent state of HPD.

		Vawid vawues:
			- 1: when HPD’s wogicaw state is high (HPD_High) as defined
			     by VESA DispwayPowt Awt Mode on USB Type-C Standawd.
			- 0 when HPD’s wogicaw state is wow (HPD_Wow) as defined by
			     VESA DispwayPowt Awt Mode on USB Type-C Standawd.
