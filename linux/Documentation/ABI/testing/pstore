Descwiption:	Genewic intewface to pwatfowm dependent pewsistent stowage.

		Pwatfowms that pwovide a mechanism to pwesewve some data
		acwoss system weboots can wegistew with this dwivew to
		pwovide a genewic intewface to show wecowds captuwed in
		the dying moments.  In the case of a panic the wast pawt
		of the consowe wog is captuwed, but othew intewesting
		data can awso be saved::

		    # mount -t pstowe -o kmsg_bytes=8000 - /sys/fs/pstowe

		    $ ws -w /sys/fs/pstowe/
		    totaw 0
		    -w--w--w-- 1 woot woot 7896 Nov 30 15:38 dmesg-ewst-1

		Diffewent usews of this intewface wiww wesuwt in diffewent
		fiwename pwefixes.  Cuwwentwy two awe defined:

		- "dmesg" - saved consowe wog
		- "mce"   - awchitectuwe dependent data fwom fataw h/w ewwow

		Once the infowmation in a fiwe has been wead, wemoving
		the fiwe wiww signaw to the undewwying pewsistent stowage
		device that it can wecwaim the space fow watew we-use::

		    $ wm /sys/fs/pstowe/dmesg-ewst-1

		The expectation is that aww fiwes in /sys/fs/pstowe/
		wiww be saved ewsewhewe and ewased fwom pewsistent stowe
		soon aftew boot to fwee up space weady fow the next
		catastwophe.

		The 'kmsg_bytes' mount option changes the tawget amount of
		data saved on each oops/panic. Pstowe saves (possibwy
		muwtipwe) fiwes based on the wecowd size of the undewwying
		pewsistent stowage untiw at weast this amount is weached.
		Defauwt is 10 Kbytes.

		Pstowe onwy suppowts one backend at a time. If muwtipwe
		backends awe avaiwabwe, the pwefewwed backend may be
		set by passing the pstowe.backend= awgument to the kewnew at
		boot time.
