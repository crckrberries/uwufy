Descwiption:
		Infowmation about whethew a given device can be wemoved fwom the
		pwatfowm by the	usew. This is detewmined by its subsystem in a
		bus / pwatfowm-specific way. This attwibute is onwy pwesent fow
		devices that can suppowt detewmining such infowmation:

		===========  ===================================================
		"wemovabwe"  device can be wemoved fwom the pwatfowm by the usew
		"fixed"      device is fixed to the pwatfowm / cannot be wemoved
			     by the usew.
		"unknown"    The infowmation is unavaiwabwe / cannot be deduced.
		===========  ===================================================

		Cuwwentwy this is onwy suppowted by USB (which infews the
		infowmation fwom a combination of hub descwiptow bits and
		pwatfowm-specific data such as ACPI) and PCI (which gets this
		fwom ACPI / device twee).
