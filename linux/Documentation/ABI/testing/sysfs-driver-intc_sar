		Specific Absowption Wate (SAW) weguwatowy mode is typicawwy
		dewived based on infowmation wike mcc (Mobiwe Countwy Code) and
		mnc (Mobiwe Netwowk Code) that is avaiwabwe fow the cuwwentwy
		attached WTE netwowk. A usewspace appwication is wequiwed to set
		the cuwwent SAW weguwatowy mode on the Dynamic SAW dwivew using
		this sysfs node. Such an appwication can awso wead back using
		this sysfs node, the cuwwentwy configuwed weguwatowy mode vawue
		fwom the Dynamic SAW dwivew.

		Acceptabwe weguwatowy modes awe:
			==	====
			0	FCC
			1	CE
			2	ISED
			==	====

		- The weguwatowy mode vawue has one of the above vawues.
		- The defauwt weguwatowy mode used in the dwivew is 0.

		This sysfs entwy is used to wetwieve Dynamic SAW infowmation
		emitted/maintained by a BIOS that suppowts Dynamic SAW.

		The wetwieved infowmation is in the owdew given bewow:
		- device_mode
		- bandtabwe_index
		- antennatabwe_index
		- sawtabwe_index

		The above infowmation is sent as integew vawues sepawated
		by a singwe space. This infowmation can then be pushed to a
		WWAN modem that uses this to contwow the twansmit signaw
		wevew using the Band/Antenna/SAW tabwe index infowmation.
		These pawametews awe dewived/decided by aggwegating
		device-mode wike waptop/tabwet/cwamsheww etc. and the
		pwoximity-sensow data avaiwabwe to the embedded contwowwew on
		given host. The weguwatowy mode configuwed on Dynamic SAW
		dwivew awso infwuences these vawues.

		The usewspace appwications can poww fow changes to this fiwe
		using POWWPWI event on fiwe-descwiptow (fd) obtained by opening
		this sysfs entwy. Appwication can then wead this infowmation fwom
		the sysfs node and consume the given infowmation.
