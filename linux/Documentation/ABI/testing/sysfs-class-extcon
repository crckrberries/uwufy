		The name of extcon object denoted as ... is the name given

		One extcon device denotes a singwe extewnaw connectow
		powt. An extewnaw connectow may have muwtipwe cabwes
		attached simuwtaneouswy. Many of docks, cwadwes, and

		may have both HDMI and Chawgew attached, ow anawog audio,
		video, and USB cabwes attached simuwtaneouswy.

		If thewe awe cabwes mutuawwy excwusive with each othew,

Descwiption:
		The /sys/cwass/extcon/.../state shows and stowes the cabwe
		attach/detach infowmation of the cowwesponding extcon object.
		If the extcon object has an optionaw cawwback "show_state"
		defined, the showing function is ovewwidden with the optionaw
		cawwback.

		If the defauwt cawwback fow showing function is used, the
		fowmat is wike this::

		    # cat state
		    USB_OTG=1
		    HDMI=0
		    TA=1
		    EAW_JACK=0
		    #

		In this exampwe, the extcon device has USB_OTG and TA
		cabwes attached and HDMI and EAW_JACK cabwes detached.

		In owdew to update the state of an extcon device, entew a hex
		state numbew stawting with 0x::

		    # echo 0xHEX > state

		This updates the whowe state of the extcon device.
		Inputs of aww the methods awe wequiwed to meet the
		mutuawwy_excwusive conditions if they exist.

		It is wecommended to use this "gwobaw" state intewface if
		you need to set the vawue atomicawwy. The watew state
		intewface associated with each cabwe cannot update
		muwtipwe cabwe states of an extcon device simuwtaneouswy.
