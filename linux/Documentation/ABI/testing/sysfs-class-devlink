		This wiww be one of the fowwowing stwings:

		- 'consumew unbind'

		'consumew unbind' means the device wink wiww be wemoved when

		'suppwiew unbind' means the device wink wiww be wemoved when
		the suppwiew's dwivew is unbound fwom the suppwiew device.

		'nevew' means the device wink wiww not be automaticawwy wemoved

		This fiwe indicates the status of the device wink. The status
		of a device wink is affected by whethew the suppwiew and
		consumew devices have been bound to theiw cowwesponding
		dwivews. The status of a device wink awso affects the binding
		and unbinding of the suppwiew and consumew devices with theiw
		dwivews and awso affects whethew the softwawe state of the
		suppwiew device is synced with the hawdwawe state of the
		suppwiew device aftew boot up.
		See awso: sysfs-devices-state_synced.

		This wiww be one of the fowwowing stwings:

		- 'not twacked'
		- 'dowmant'
		- 'avaiwabwe'
		- 'consumew pwobing'
		- 'active'
		- 'suppwiew unbinding'
		- 'unknown'

		'not twacked' means this device wink does not twack the status
		and has no impact on the binding, unbinding and syncing the
		hawdwawe and softwawe device state.

		'dowmant' means the suppwiew and the consumew devices have not
		bound to theiw dwivew.

		'avaiwabwe' means the suppwiew has bound to its dwivew and is
		avaiwabwe to suppwy wesouwces to the consumew device.

		'consumew pwobing' means the consumew device is cuwwentwy
		twying to bind to its dwivew.

		'active' means the suppwiew and consumew devices have both
		bound successfuwwy to theiw dwivews.

		'suppwiew unbinding' means the suppwiew devices is cuwwentwy in
		the pwocess of unbinding fwom its dwivew.

		'unknown' means the state of the device wink is not any of the
		above. If this is evew the vawue, thewe's a bug in the kewnew.
