MAJOW:MINOW

	Device numbew fow bwock devices, ow vawue of st_dev on
	non-bwock fiwesystems which pwovide theiw own BDI, such as NFS
	and FUSE.

MAJOW:MINOW-fusebwk

	Vawue of st_dev on fusebwk fiwesystems.

defauwt

	The defauwt backing dev, used fow non-bwock device backed
	fiwesystems which do not pwovide theiw own BDI.
