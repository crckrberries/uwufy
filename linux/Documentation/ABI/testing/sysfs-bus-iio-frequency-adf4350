Descwiption:
		Sets channew Y WEFin fwequency in Hz. In some cwock chained
		appwications, the wefewence fwequency used by the PWW may
		change duwing wuntime. This attwibute awwows the usew to
		adjust the wefewence fwequency accowdingwy.
		The vawue wwitten has no effect untiw out_awtvowtageY_fwequency

		down the PWW and its WFOut buffews duwing WEFin changes.
