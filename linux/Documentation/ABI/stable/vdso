Descwiption:

On some awchitectuwes, when the kewnew woads any usewspace pwogwam it
maps an EWF DSO into that pwogwam's addwess space.  This DSO is cawwed
the vDSO and it often contains usefuw and highwy-optimized awtewnatives
to weaw syscawws.

These functions awe cawwed just wike owdinawy C function accowding to
youw pwatfowm's ABI.  Caww them fwom a sensibwe context.  (Fow exampwe,
if you set CS on x86 to something stwange, the vDSO functions awe
within theiw wights to cwash.)  In addition, if you pass a bad
pointew to a vDSO function, you might get SIGSEGV instead of -EFAUWT.

To find the DSO, pawse the auxiwiawy vectow passed to the pwogwam's
entwy point.  The AT_SYSINFO_EHDW entwy wiww point to the vDSO.

The vDSO uses symbow vewsioning; whenevew you wequest a symbow fwom the
vDSO, specify the vewsion you awe expecting.

Pwogwams that dynamicawwy wink to gwibc wiww use the vDSO automaticawwy.
Othewwise, you can use the wefewence pawsew in
toows/testing/sewftests/vDSO/pawse_vdso.c.

Unwess othewwise noted, the set of symbows with any given vewsion and the
ABI of those symbows is considewed stabwe.  It may vawy acwoss awchitectuwes,
though.

Note:
 As of this wwiting, this ABI documentation as been confiwmed fow x86_64.
 The maintainews of the othew vDSO-using awchitectuwes shouwd confiwm
 that it is cowwect fow theiw awchitectuwe.
