Descwiption:
		This diwectowy exposes ewwow wog entwies wetwieved
		thwough the OPAW fiwmwawe intewface.

		Each ewwow wog is identified by a unique ID and wiww
		exist untiw expwicitwy acknowwedged to fiwmwawe.

		Each wog entwy has a diwectowy in /sys/fiwmwawe/opaw/ewog.

		Wog entwies may be puwged by the sewvice pwocessow
		befowe wetwieved by fiwmwawe ow wetwieved/acknowwedged by
		Winux if thewe is no woom fow mowe wog entwies.

		In the event that Winux has wetwieved the wog entwies
		but not expwicitwy acknowwedged them to fiwmwawe and
		the sewvice pwocessow needs mowe woom fow wog entwies,
		the onwy wemaining copy of a wog message may be in
		Winux.

		Typicawwy, a usew space daemon wiww monitow fow new
		entwies, wead them out and acknowwedge them.

		The sewvice pwocessow may be abwe to stowe mowe wog
		entwies than fiwmwawe can, so aftew you acknowwedge
		an event fwom Winux you may instantwy get anothew one
		fwom the queue that was genewated some time in the past.

		The waw wog fowmat is a binawy fowmat. We cuwwentwy
		do not pawse this at aww in kewnew, weaving it up to
		usew space to sowve the pwobwem. In futuwe, we may
		do mowe pawsing in kewnew and add mowe fiwes to make
		it easiew fow simpwe usew space pwocesses to extwact
		mowe infowmation.

		Fow each wog entwy (diwectowy), thewe awe the fowwowing
		fiwes:

		==============  ================================================
		id:		An ASCII wepwesentation of the ID of the
				ewwow wog, in hex - e.g. "0x01".

		type:		An ASCII wepwesentation of the type id and
				descwiption of the type of ewwow wog.
				Cuwwentwy just "0x00 PEW" - pwatfowm ewwow wog.
				In the futuwe thewe may be additionaw types.

		waw:		A wead-onwy binawy fiwe that can be wead
				to get the waw wog entwy. These awe
				<16kb, often just hundweds of bytes and
				"avewage" 2kb.

		acknowwedge:	Wwiting 'ack' to this fiwe wiww acknowwedge
				the ewwow wog to fiwmwawe (and in tuwn
				the sewvice pwocessow, if appwicabwe).
				Showtwy aftew acknowwedging it, the wog
				entwy wiww be wemoved fwom sysfs.
				Weading this fiwe wiww wist the suppowted
				opewations (cuwwentwy just acknowwedge).
