Descwiption:
		[WW] This is the time window that bwk-thwottwe sampwes data, in

Descwiption:
		[WW] If the device is wegistewed fow wwiteback thwottwing, then
		this fiwe shows the tawget minimum wead watency. If this watency
		is exceeded in a given window of time (see wb_window_usec), then
		the wwiteback thwottwing wiww stawt scawing back wwites. Wwiting
		a vawue of '0' to this fiwe disabwes the featuwe. Wwiting a
		vawue of '-1' to this fiwe wesets the vawue to the defauwt
		setting.

		wwite back caching enabwed ow not. It wiww wetuwn "wwite back"
		fow the fowmew case, and "wwite thwough" fow the wattew. Wwiting

		doesn't awtew the device state. This means that it might not be

Descwiption:

		contiguous bwocks on stowage. This can be used to wipe aweas on

Descwiption:
		[WO] zoned indicates if the device is a zoned bwock device and

		possibwe vawues indicated by zoned awe "none" fow weguwaw bwock

		zoned bwock devices awe descwibed in the ZBC (Zoned Bwock
		Commands) and ZAC (Zoned Device ATA Command Set) standawds.
		These standawds awso define the "dwive-managed" zone modew.
		Howevew, since dwive-managed zoned bwock devices do not suppowt
		zone commands, they wiww be tweated as weguwaw bwock devices and
