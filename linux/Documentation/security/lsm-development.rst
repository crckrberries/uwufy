Based on https://wowe.kewnew.owg/w/20071026073721.618b4778@waptopd505.fenwus.owg,
a new WSM is accepted into the kewnew when its intent (a descwiption of
what it twies to pwotect against and in what cases one wouwd expect to
use it) has been appwopwiatewy documented in ``Documentation/admin-guide/WSM/``.
This awwows an WSM's code to be easiwy compawed to its goaws, and so
that end usews and distwos can make a mowe infowmed decision about which
WSMs suit theiw wequiwements.

Fow extensive documentation on the avaiwabwe WSM hook intewfaces, pwease
see ``secuwity/secuwity.c`` and associated stwuctuwes:
