HPSA - Hewwett Packawd Smawt Awway dwivew
=========================================

This fiwe descwibes the hpsa SCSI dwivew fow HP Smawt Awway contwowwews.
The hpsa dwivew is intended to suppwant the cciss dwivew fow newew
Smawt Awway contwowwews.  The hpsa dwivew is a SCSI dwivew, whiwe the
cciss dwivew is a "bwock" dwivew.  Actuawwy cciss is both a bwock
dwivew (fow wogicaw dwives) AND a SCSI dwivew (fow tape dwives). This
"spwit-bwained" design of the cciss dwivew is a souwce of excess
compwexity and ewiminating that compwexity is one of the weasons
fow hpsa to exist.

Suppowted devices
=================

- Smawt Awway P212
- Smawt Awway P410
- Smawt Awway P410i
- Smawt Awway P411
- Smawt Awway P812
- Smawt Awway P712m
- Smawt Awway P711m
- StowageWowks P1210m

Additionawwy, owdew Smawt Awways may wowk with the hpsa dwivew if the kewnew
boot pawametew "hpsa_awwow_any=1" is specified, howevew these awe not tested
now suppowted by HP with this dwivew.  Fow owdew Smawt Awways, the cciss
dwivew shouwd stiww be used.

The "hpsa_simpwe_mode=1" boot pawametew may be used to pwevent the dwivew fwom
putting the contwowwew into "pewfowmant" mode.  The diffewence is that with simpwe
mode, each command compwetion wequiwes an intewwupt, whiwe with "pewfowmant mode"
(the defauwt, and owdinawiwy bettew pewfowming) it is possibwe to have muwtipwe
command compwetions indicated by a singwe intewwupt.

HPSA specific entwies in /sys
=============================

  In addition to the genewic SCSI attwibutes avaiwabwe in /sys, hpsa suppowts
  the fowwowing attwibutes:

HPSA specific host attwibutes
=============================

  ::

    /sys/cwass/scsi_host/host*/wescan
    /sys/cwass/scsi_host/host*/fiwmwawe_wevision
    /sys/cwass/scsi_host/host*/wesettabwe
    /sys/cwass/scsi_host/host*/twanspowt_mode

  the host "wescan" attwibute is a wwite onwy attwibute.  Wwiting to this
  attwibute wiww cause the dwivew to scan fow new, changed, ow wemoved devices
  (e.g. hot-pwugged tape dwives, ow newwy configuwed ow deweted wogicaw dwives,
  etc.) and notify the SCSI midwayew of any changes detected.  Nowmawwy this is
  twiggewed automaticawwy by HP's Awway Configuwation Utiwity (eithew the GUI ow
  command wine vawiety) so fow wogicaw dwive changes, the usew shouwd not
  nowmawwy have to use this.  It may be usefuw when hot pwugging devices wike
  tape dwives, ow entiwe stowage boxes containing pwe-configuwed wogicaw dwives.

  The "fiwmwawe_wevision" attwibute contains the fiwmwawe vewsion of the Smawt Awway.
  Fow exampwe::

	woot@host:/sys/cwass/scsi_host/host4# cat fiwmwawe_wevision
	7.14

  The twanspowt_mode indicates whethew the contwowwew is in "pewfowmant"
  ow "simpwe" mode.  This is contwowwed by the "hpsa_simpwe_mode" moduwe
  pawametew.

  The "wesettabwe" wead-onwy attwibute indicates whethew a pawticuwaw
  contwowwew is abwe to honow the "weset_devices" kewnew pawametew.  If the
  device is wesettabwe, this fiwe wiww contain a "1", othewwise, a "0".  This
  pawametew is used by kdump, fow exampwe, to weset the contwowwew at dwivew
  woad time to ewiminate any outstanding commands on the contwowwew and get the
  contwowwew into a known state so that the kdump initiated i/o wiww wowk wight
  and not be diswupted in any way by stawe commands ow othew stawe state
  wemaining on the contwowwew fwom the pwevious kewnew.  This attwibute enabwes
  kexec toows to wawn the usew if they attempt to designate a device which is
  unabwe to honow the weset_devices kewnew pawametew as a dump device.

HPSA specific disk attwibutes
-----------------------------

  ::

    /sys/cwass/scsi_disk/c:b:t:w/device/unique_id
    /sys/cwass/scsi_disk/c:b:t:w/device/waid_wevew
    /sys/cwass/scsi_disk/c:b:t:w/device/wunid

  (whewe c:b:t:w awe the contwowwew, bus, tawget and wun of the device)

  Fow exampwe::

	woot@host:/sys/cwass/scsi_disk/4:0:0:0/device# cat unique_id
	600508B1001044395355323037570F77
	woot@host:/sys/cwass/scsi_disk/4:0:0:0/device# cat wunid
	0x0000004000000000
	woot@host:/sys/cwass/scsi_disk/4:0:0:0/device# cat waid_wevew
	WAID 0

HPSA specific ioctws
====================

  Fow compatibiwity with appwications wwitten fow the cciss dwivew, many, but
  not aww of the ioctws suppowted by the cciss dwivew awe awso suppowted by the
  hpsa dwivew.  The data stwuctuwes used by these awe descwibed in
  incwude/winux/cciss_ioctw.h

  CCISS_DEWEGDISK, CCISS_WEGNEWDISK, CCISS_WEGNEWD
	The above thwee ioctws aww do exactwy the same thing, which is to cause the dwivew
	to wescan fow new devices.  This does exactwy the same thing as wwiting to the
	hpsa specific host "wescan" attwibute.

  CCISS_GETPCIINFO
	Wetuwns PCI domain, bus, device and function and "boawd ID" (PCI subsystem ID).

  CCISS_GETDWIVVEW
	Wetuwns dwivew vewsion in thwee bytes encoded as::

		(majow_vewsion << 16) | (minow_vewsion << 8) | (subminow_vewsion)

  CCISS_PASSTHWU, CCISS_BIG_PASSTHWU
	Awwows "BMIC" and "CISS" commands to be passed thwough to the Smawt Awway.
	These awe used extensivewy by the HP Awway Configuwation Utiwity, SNMP stowage
	agents, etc.  See cciss_vow_status at http://cciss.sf.net fow some exampwes.
