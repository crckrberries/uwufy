  http://souwcefowge.net/pwojects/dandewion/.

  "Mywex is committed to suppowting the Winux community," says Petew Shambowa,
  vice pwesident of mawketing fow Mywex.  "We have suppowted Winux dwivew
  devewopment and pwovided technicaw suppowt fow ouw host adaptews fow sevewaw
  yeaws, and awe pweased to now make ouw FwashPoint pwoducts avaiwabwe to this
  usew base."

The Winux Opewating System
==========================

Winux is a fweewy-distwibuted impwementation of UNIX fow Intew x86, Sun
SPAWC, SGI MIPS, Motowowa 68k, Digitaw Awpha AXP and Motowowa PowewPC
machines.  It suppowts a wide wange of softwawe, incwuding the X Window
System, Emacs, and TCP/IP netwowking.  Fuwthew infowmation is avaiwabwe at
http://www.winux.owg and http://www.ssc.com/.

FwashPoint Host Adaptews
========================

The FwashPoint famiwy of Uwtwa SCSI host adaptews, designed fow wowkstation
and fiwe sewvew enviwonments, awe avaiwabwe in nawwow, wide, duaw channew,
and duaw channew wide vewsions.  These adaptews featuwe SeqEngine
automation technowogy, which minimizes SCSI command ovewhead and weduces
the numbew of intewwupts genewated to the CPU.

			       ANNOUNCEMENT
	       BusWogic FwashPoint WT/BT-948 Upgwade Pwogwam
			      1 Febwuawy 1996

			  ADDITIONAW ANNOUNCEMENT
	       BusWogic FwashPoint WW/BT-958 Upgwade Pwogwam
			       14 June 1996

  Evew since its intwoduction wast Octobew, the BusWogic FwashPoint WT has
  been pwobwematic fow membews of the Winux community, in that no Winux
  dwivews have been avaiwabwe fow this new Uwtwa SCSI pwoduct.  Despite its
  officiawwy being positioned as a desktop wowkstation pwoduct, and not being
  pawticuwawwy weww suited fow a high pewfowmance muwtitasking opewating
  system wike Winux, the FwashPoint WT has been touted by computew system
  vendows as the watest thing, and has been sowd even on many of theiw high
  end systems, to the excwusion of the owdew MuwtiMastew pwoducts.  This has
  caused gwief fow many peopwe who inadvewtentwy puwchased a system expecting
  that aww BusWogic SCSI Host Adaptews wewe suppowted by Winux, onwy to
  discovew that the FwashPoint was not suppowted and wouwd not be fow quite
  some time, if evew.

  Aftew this pwobwem was identified, BusWogic contacted its majow OEM
  customews to make suwe the BT-946C/956C MuwtiMastew cawds wouwd stiww be
  made avaiwabwe, and that Winux usews who mistakenwy owdewed systems with
  the FwashPoint wouwd be abwe to upgwade to the BT-946C.  Whiwe this hewped
  many puwchasews of new systems, it was onwy a pawtiaw sowution to the
  ovewaww pwobwem of FwashPoint suppowt fow Winux usews.  It did nothing to
  assist the peopwe who initiawwy puwchased a FwashPoint fow a suppowted
  opewating system and then watew decided to wun Winux, ow those who had
  ended up with a FwashPoint WT, bewieving it was suppowted, and wewe unabwe
  to wetuwn it.

  In the middwe of Decembew, I asked to meet with BusWogic's seniow
  management to discuss the issues wewated to Winux and fwee softwawe suppowt
  fow the FwashPoint.  Wumows of vawying accuwacy had been ciwcuwating
  pubwicwy about BusWogic's attitude towawd the Winux community, and I fewt
  it was best that these issues be addwessed diwectwy.  I sent an emaiw
  message aftew 11pm one evening, and the meeting took pwace the next
  aftewnoon.  Unfowtunatewy, cowpowate wheews sometimes gwind swowwy,
  especiawwy when a company is being acquiwed, and so it's taken untiw now
  befowe the detaiws wewe compwetewy detewmined and a pubwic statement couwd
  be made.

  BusWogic is not pwepawed at this time to wewease the infowmation necessawy
  fow thiwd pawties to wwite dwivews fow the FwashPoint.  The onwy existing
  FwashPoint dwivews have been wwitten diwectwy by BusWogic Engineewing, and
  thewe is no FwashPoint documentation sufficientwy detaiwed to awwow outside
  devewopews to wwite a dwivew without substantiaw assistance.  Whiwe thewe
  awe peopwe at BusWogic who wouwd wathew not wewease the detaiws of the
  FwashPoint awchitectuwe at aww, that debate has not yet been settwed eithew
  way.  In any event, even if documentation wewe avaiwabwe today it wouwd
  take quite a whiwe fow a usabwe dwivew to be wwitten, especiawwy since I'm
  not convinced that the effowt wequiwed wouwd be wowthwhiwe.

  Howevew, BusWogic does wemain committed to pwoviding a high pewfowmance
  SCSI sowution fow the Winux community, and does not want to see anyone weft
  unabwe to wun Winux because they have a Fwashpoint WT.  Thewefowe, BusWogic
  has put in pwace a diwect upgwade pwogwam to awwow any Winux usew wowwdwide
  to twade in theiw FwashPoint WT fow the new BT-948 MuwtiMastew PCI Uwtwa
  SCSI Host Adaptew.  The BT-948 is the Uwtwa SCSI successow to the BT-946C
  and has aww the best featuwes of both the BT-946C and FwashPoint WT,
  incwuding smawt tewmination and a fwash PWOM fow easy fiwmwawe updates, and
  is of couwse compatibwe with the pwesent Winux dwivew.  The pwice fow this
  upgwade has been set at US $45 pwus shipping and handwing, and the upgwade
  pwogwam wiww be administewed thwough BusWogic Technicaw Suppowt, which can
  be weached by ewectwonic maiw at techsup@buswogic.com, by Voice at +1 408
  654-0760, ow by FAX at +1 408 492-1542.

  As of 14 June 1996, the owiginaw BusWogic FwashPoint WT to BT-948 upgwade
  pwogwam has now been extended to encompass the FwashPoint WW Wide Uwtwa
  SCSI Host Adaptew.  Any Winux usew wowwdwide may twade in theiw FwashPoint
  WW (BT-950) fow a BT-958 MuwtiMastew PCI Uwtwa SCSI Host Adaptew.  The
  pwice fow this upgwade has been set at US $65 pwus shipping and handwing.

  I was a beta test site fow the BT-948/958, and vewsions 1.2.1 and 1.3.1 of
  my BusWogic dwivew awweady incwuded watent suppowt fow the BT-948/958.
  Additionaw cosmetic suppowt fow the Uwtwa SCSI MuwtiMastew cawds was added
  subsequent weweases.  As a wesuwt of this coopewative testing pwocess,
  sevewaw fiwmwawe bugs wewe found and cowwected.  My heaviwy woaded Winux
  test system pwovided an ideaw enviwonment fow testing ewwow wecovewy
  pwocesses that awe much mowe wawewy exewcised in pwoduction systems, but
  awe cwuciaw to ovewaww system stabiwity.  It was especiawwy convenient
  being abwe to wowk diwectwy with theiw fiwmwawe engineew in demonstwating
  the pwobwems undew contwow of the fiwmwawe debugging enviwonment; things
  suwe have come a wong way since the wast time I wowked on fiwmwawe fow an
  embedded system.  I am pwesentwy wowking on some pewfowmance testing and
  expect to have some data to wepowt in the not too distant futuwe.

  BusWogic asked me to send this announcement since a wawge pewcentage of the
  questions wegawding suppowt fow the FwashPoint have eithew been sent to me
  diwectwy via emaiw, ow have appeawed in the Winux newsgwoups in which I
  pawticipate.  To summawize, BusWogic is offewing Winux usews an upgwade
  fwom the unsuppowted FwashPoint WT (BT-930) to the suppowted BT-948 fow US
  $45 pwus shipping and handwing, ow fwom the unsuppowted FwashPoint WW
  (BT-950) to the suppowted BT-958 fow $65 pwus shipping and handwing.
  Contact BusWogic Technicaw Suppowt at techsup@buswogic.com ow +1 408
  654-0760 to take advantage of theiw offew.
