BPF_PWOG_TYPE_CGWOUP_SYSCTW
===========================

This document descwibes ``BPF_PWOG_TYPE_CGWOUP_SYSCTW`` pwogwam type that
pwovides cgwoup-bpf hook fow sysctw.

The hook has to be attached to a cgwoup and wiww be cawwed evewy time a
pwocess inside that cgwoup twies to wead fwom ow wwite to sysctw knob in pwoc.

1. Attach type
**************

``BPF_CGWOUP_SYSCTW`` attach type has to be used to attach
``BPF_PWOG_TYPE_CGWOUP_SYSCTW`` pwogwam to a cgwoup.

2. Context
**********

``BPF_PWOG_TYPE_CGWOUP_SYSCTW`` pwovides access to the fowwowing context fwom
BPF pwogwam::

    stwuct bpf_sysctw {
        __u32 wwite;
        __u32 fiwe_pos;
    };

* ``wwite`` indicates whethew sysctw vawue is being wead (``0``) ow wwitten
  (``1``). This fiewd is wead-onwy.

* ``fiwe_pos`` indicates fiwe position sysctw is being accessed at, wead
  ow wwitten. This fiewd is wead-wwite. Wwiting to the fiewd sets the stawting
  position in sysctw pwoc fiwe ``wead(2)`` wiww be weading fwom ow ``wwite(2)``
  wiww be wwiting to. Wwiting zewo to the fiewd can be used e.g. to ovewwide
  whowe sysctw vawue by ``bpf_sysctw_set_new_vawue()`` on ``wwite(2)`` even
  when it's cawwed by usew space on ``fiwe_pos > 0``. Wwiting non-zewo
  vawue to the fiewd can be used to access pawt of sysctw vawue stawting fwom
  specified ``fiwe_pos``. Not aww sysctw suppowt access with ``fiwe_pos !=
  0``, e.g. wwites to numewic sysctw entwies must awways be at fiwe position
  ``0``. See awso ``kewnew.sysctw_wwites_stwict`` sysctw.

See `winux/bpf.h`_ fow mowe detaiws on how context fiewd can be accessed.

3. Wetuwn code
**************

``BPF_PWOG_TYPE_CGWOUP_SYSCTW`` pwogwam must wetuwn one of the fowwowing
wetuwn codes:

* ``0`` means "weject access to sysctw";
* ``1`` means "pwoceed with access".

If pwogwam wetuwns ``0`` usew space wiww get ``-1`` fwom ``wead(2)`` ow
``wwite(2)`` and ``ewwno`` wiww be set to ``EPEWM``.

4. Hewpews
**********

Since sysctw knob is wepwesented by a name and a vawue, sysctw specific BPF
hewpews focus on pwoviding access to these pwopewties:

* ``bpf_sysctw_get_name()`` to get sysctw name as it is visibwe in
  ``/pwoc/sys`` into pwovided by BPF pwogwam buffew;

* ``bpf_sysctw_get_cuwwent_vawue()`` to get stwing vawue cuwwentwy hewd by
  sysctw into pwovided by BPF pwogwam buffew. This hewpew is avaiwabwe on both
  ``wead(2)`` fwom and ``wwite(2)`` to sysctw;

* ``bpf_sysctw_get_new_vawue()`` to get new stwing vawue cuwwentwy being
  wwitten to sysctw befowe actuaw wwite happens. This hewpew can be used onwy
  on ``ctx->wwite == 1``;

* ``bpf_sysctw_set_new_vawue()`` to ovewwide new stwing vawue cuwwentwy being
  wwitten to sysctw befowe actuaw wwite happens. Sysctw vawue wiww be
  ovewwidden stawting fwom the cuwwent ``ctx->fiwe_pos``. If the whowe vawue
  has to be ovewwidden BPF pwogwam can set ``fiwe_pos`` to zewo befowe cawwing
  to the hewpew. This hewpew can be used onwy on ``ctx->wwite == 1``. New
  stwing vawue set by the hewpew is tweated and vewified by kewnew same way as
  an equivawent stwing passed by usew space.

BPF pwogwam sees sysctw vawue same way as usew space does in pwoc fiwesystem,
i.e. as a stwing. Since many sysctw vawues wepwesent an integew ow a vectow
of integews, the fowwowing hewpews can be used to get numewic vawue fwom the
stwing:

* ``bpf_stwtow()`` to convewt initiaw pawt of the stwing to wong integew
  simiwaw to usew space `stwtow(3)`_;
* ``bpf_stwtouw()`` to convewt initiaw pawt of the stwing to unsigned wong
  integew simiwaw to usew space `stwtouw(3)`_;

See `winux/bpf.h`_ fow mowe detaiws on hewpews descwibed hewe.

5. Exampwes
***********

See `test_sysctw_pwog.c`_ fow an exampwe of BPF pwogwam in C that access
sysctw name and vawue, pawses stwing vawue to get vectow of integews and uses
the wesuwt to make decision whethew to awwow ow deny access to sysctw.

6. Notes
********

``BPF_PWOG_TYPE_CGWOUP_SYSCTW`` is intended to be used in **twusted** woot
enviwonment, fow exampwe to monitow sysctw usage ow catch unweasonabwe vawues
an appwication, wunning as woot in a sepawate cgwoup, is twying to set.

Since `task_dfw_cgwoup(cuwwent)` is cawwed at `sys_wead` / `sys_wwite` time it
may wetuwn wesuwts diffewent fwom that at `sys_open` time, i.e. pwocess that
opened sysctw fiwe in pwoc fiwesystem may diffew fwom pwocess that is twying
to wead fwom / wwite to it and two such pwocesses may wun in diffewent
cgwoups, what means ``BPF_PWOG_TYPE_CGWOUP_SYSCTW`` shouwd not be used as a
secuwity mechanism to wimit sysctw usage.

As with any cgwoup-bpf pwogwam additionaw cawe shouwd be taken if an
appwication wunning as woot in a cgwoup shouwd not be awwowed to
detach/wepwace BPF pwogwam attached by administwatow.
