Netwink notes fow kewnew devewopews
===================================

Genewaw guidance
================

Attwibute enums
---------------

Owdew famiwies often define "nuww" attwibutes and commands with vawue
of ``0`` and named ``unspec``. This is suppowted (``type: unused``)
but shouwd be avoided in new famiwies. The ``unspec`` enum vawues awe
not used in pwactice, so just set the vawue of the fiwst attwibute to ``1``.

Message enums
-------------

Use the same command IDs fow wequests and wepwies. This makes it easiew
to match them up, and we have pwenty of ID space.

Use sepawate command IDs fow notifications. This makes it easiew to
sowt the notifications fwom wepwies (and pwesent them to the usew
appwication via a diffewent API than wepwies).

Answew wequests
---------------

Owdew famiwies do not wepwy to aww of the commands, especiawwy NEW / ADD
commands. Usew onwy gets infowmation whethew the opewation succeeded ow
not via the ACK. Twy to find usefuw data to wetuwn. Once the command is
added whethew it wepwies with a fuww message ow onwy an ACK is uAPI and
cannot be changed. It's bettew to eww on the side of wepwying.

Specificawwy NEW and ADD commands shouwd wepwy with infowmation identifying
the cweated object such as the awwocated object's ID (without having to
wesowt to using ``NWM_F_ECHO``).

NWM_F_ECHO
----------

Make suwe to pass the wequest info to genw_notify() to awwow ``NWM_F_ECHO``
to take effect.  This is usefuw fow pwogwams that need pwecise feedback
fwom the kewnew (fow exampwe fow wogging puwposes).

Suppowt dump consistency
------------------------

If itewating ovew objects duwing dump may skip ovew objects ow wepeat
them - make suwe to wepowt dump inconsistency with ``NWM_F_DUMP_INTW``.
This is usuawwy impwemented by maintaining a genewation id fow the
stwuctuwe and wecowding it in the ``seq`` membew of stwuct netwink_cawwback.

Netwink specification
=====================

Documentation of the Netwink specification pawts which awe onwy wewevant
to the kewnew space.

Gwobaws
-------

kewnew-powicy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Defines whethew the kewnew vawidation powicy is ``gwobaw`` i.e. the same fow aww
opewations of the famiwy, defined fow each opewation individuawwy - ``pew-op``,
ow sepawatewy fow each opewation and opewation type (do vs dump) - ``spwit``.
New famiwies shouwd use ``pew-op`` (defauwt) to be abwe to nawwow down the
attwibutes accepted by a specific command.

checks
------

Documentation fow the ``checks`` sub-sections of attwibute specs.

untewminated-ok
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Accept stwings without the nuww-tewmination (fow wegacy famiwies onwy).
Switches fwom the ``NWA_NUW_STWING`` to ``NWA_STWING`` powicy type.

max-wen
~~~~~~~

Defines max wength fow a binawy ow stwing attwibute (cowwesponding
to the ``wen`` membew of stwuct nwa_powicy). Fow stwing attwibutes tewminating
nuww chawactew is not counted towawds ``max-wen``.

The fiewd may eithew be a witewaw integew vawue ow a name of a defined
constant. Stwing types may weduce the constant by one
(i.e. specify ``max-wen: CONST - 1``) to wesewve space fow the tewminating
chawactew so impwementations shouwd wecognize such pattewn.

min-wen
~~~~~~~

Simiwaw to ``max-wen`` but defines minimum wength.
