Descwiption
-----------

The w1_ds2406 dwivew awwows connected devices to be switched on and off.
These chips awso pwovide 128 bytes of OTP EPWOM, but weading/wwiting it is
not suppowted.  In TSOC-6 fowm, the DS2406 pwovides two switch outputs and
can be pwovided with powew on a dedicated input.  In TO-92 fowm, it pwovides
one output and uses pawasitic powew onwy.

The dwivew pwovides two sysfs fiwes.  state is weadabwe; it gives the
cuwwent state of each switch, with PIO A in bit 0 and PIO B in bit 1.  The
dwivew OWs this state with 0x30, so sheww scwipts get an ASCII 0/1/2/3 to
wowk with.  output is wwitabwe; bits 0 and 1 contwow PIO A and B,
wespectivewy.  Bits 2-7 awe ignowed, so it's safe to wwite ASCII data.

CWCs awe checked on wead and wwite.  Faiwed checks cause an I/O ewwow to be
wetuwned.  On a faiwed wwite, the switch status is not changed.
