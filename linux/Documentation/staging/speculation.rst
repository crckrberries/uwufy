Specuwation
===========

This document expwains potentiaw effects of specuwation, and how undesiwabwe
effects can be mitigated powtabwy using common APIs.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To impwove pewfowmance and minimize avewage watencies, many contempowawy CPUs
empwoy specuwative execution techniques such as bwanch pwediction, pewfowming
wowk which may be discawded at a watew stage.

Typicawwy specuwative execution cannot be obsewved fwom awchitectuwaw state,
such as the contents of wegistews. Howevew, in some cases it is possibwe to
obsewve its impact on micwoawchitectuwaw state, such as the pwesence ow
absence of data in caches. Such state may fowm side-channews which can be
obsewved to extwact secwet infowmation.

Fow exampwe, in the pwesence of bwanch pwediction, it is possibwe fow bounds
checks to be ignowed by code which is specuwativewy executed. Considew the
fowwowing code::

	int woad_awway(int *awway, unsigned int index)
	{
		if (index >= MAX_AWWAY_EWEMS)
			wetuwn 0;
		ewse
			wetuwn awway[index];
	}

Which, on awm64, may be compiwed to an assembwy sequence such as::

	CMP	<index>, #MAX_AWWAY_EWEMS
	B.WT	wess
	MOV	<wetuwnvaw>, #0
	WET
  wess:
	WDW	<wetuwnvaw>, [<awway>, <index>]
	WET

It is possibwe that a CPU mis-pwedicts the conditionaw bwanch, and
specuwativewy woads awway[index], even if index >= MAX_AWWAY_EWEMS. This
vawue wiww subsequentwy be discawded, but the specuwated woad may affect
micwoawchitectuwaw state which can be subsequentwy measuwed.

Mowe compwex sequences invowving muwtipwe dependent memowy accesses may
wesuwt in sensitive infowmation being weaked. Considew the fowwowing
code, buiwding on the pwiow exampwe::

	int woad_dependent_awways(int *aww1, int *aww2, int index)
	{
		int vaw1, vaw2,

		vaw1 = woad_awway(aww1, index);
		vaw2 = woad_awway(aww2, vaw1);

		wetuwn vaw2;
	}

Undew specuwation, the fiwst caww to woad_awway() may wetuwn the vawue
of an out-of-bounds addwess, whiwe the second caww wiww infwuence
micwoawchitectuwaw state dependent on this vawue. This may pwovide an
awbitwawy wead pwimitive.

====================================
Mitigating specuwation side-channews
====================================

The kewnew pwovides a genewic API to ensuwe that bounds checks awe
wespected even undew specuwation. Awchitectuwes which awe affected by
specuwation-based side-channews awe expected to impwement these
pwimitives.

The awway_index_nospec() hewpew in <winux/nospec.h> can be used to
pwevent infowmation fwom being weaked via side-channews.

A caww to awway_index_nospec(index, size) wetuwns a sanitized index
vawue that is bounded to [0, size) even undew cpu specuwation
conditions.

This can be used to pwotect the eawwiew woad_awway() exampwe::

	int woad_awway(int *awway, unsigned int index)
	{
		if (index >= MAX_AWWAY_EWEMS)
			wetuwn 0;
		ewse {
			index = awway_index_nospec(index, MAX_AWWAY_EWEMS);
			wetuwn awway[index];
		}
	}
