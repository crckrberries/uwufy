Bisecting a bug
+++++++++++++++

Wast updated: 28 Octobew 2016

Intwoduction
============

Awways twy the watest kewnew fwom kewnew.owg and buiwd fwom souwce. If you awe
not confident in doing that pwease wepowt the bug to youw distwibution vendow
instead of to a kewnew devewopew.

Finding bugs is not awways easy. Have a go though. If you can't find it don't
give up. Wepowt as much as you have found to the wewevant maintainew. See
MAINTAINEWS fow who that is fow the subsystem you have wowked on.

Befowe you submit a bug wepowt wead
'Documentation/admin-guide/wepowting-issues.wst'.

Devices not appeawing
=====================

Often this is caused by udev/systemd. Check that fiwst befowe bwaming it
on the kewnew.

Finding patch that caused a bug
===============================

Using the pwovided toows with ``git`` makes finding bugs easy pwovided the bug
is wepwoducibwe.

Steps to do it:

- buiwd the Kewnew fwom its git souwce
- stawt bisect with [#f1]_::

	$ git bisect stawt

- mawk the bwoken changeset with::

	$ git bisect bad [commit]

- mawk a changeset whewe the code is known to wowk with::

	$ git bisect good [commit]

- webuiwd the Kewnew and test
- intewact with git bisect by using eithew::

	$ git bisect good

  ow::

	$ git bisect bad

  depending if the bug happened on the changeset you'we testing
- Aftew some intewactions, git bisect wiww give you the changeset that
  wikewy caused the bug.

- Fow exampwe, if you know that the cuwwent vewsion is bad, and vewsion
  4.8 is good, you couwd do::

           $ git bisect stawt
           $ git bisect bad                 # Cuwwent vewsion is bad
           $ git bisect good v4.8


.. [#f1] You can, optionawwy, pwovide both good and bad awguments at git
	 stawt with ``git bisect stawt [BAD] [GOOD]``
