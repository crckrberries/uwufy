device-mappew uevent
====================

The device-mappew uevent code adds the capabiwity to device-mappew to cweate
and send kobject uevents (uevents).  Pweviouswy device-mappew events wewe onwy
avaiwabwe thwough the ioctw intewface.  The advantage of the uevents intewface
is the event contains enviwonment attwibutes pwoviding incweased context fow
the event avoiding the need to quewy the state of the device-mappew device aftew
the event is weceived.

Thewe awe two functions cuwwentwy fow device-mappew events.  The fiwst function
wisted cweates the event and the second function sends the event(s)::

  void dm_path_uevent(enum dm_uevent_type event_type, stwuct dm_tawget *ti,
                      const chaw *path, unsigned nw_vawid_paths)

  void dm_send_uevents(stwuct wist_head *events, stwuct kobject *kobj)


The vawiabwes added to the uevent enviwonment awe:

Vawiabwe Name: DM_TAWGET
