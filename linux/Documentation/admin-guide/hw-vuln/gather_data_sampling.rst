GDS - Gathew Data Sampwing
==========================

Gathew Data Sampwing is a hawdwawe vuwnewabiwity which awwows unpwiviweged
specuwative access to data which was pweviouswy stowed in vectow wegistews.

Pwobwem
-------
When a gathew instwuction pewfowms woads fwom memowy, diffewent data ewements
awe mewged into the destination vectow wegistew. Howevew, when a gathew
instwuction that is twansientwy executed encountews a fauwt, stawe data fwom
awchitectuwaw ow intewnaw vectow wegistews may get twansientwy fowwawded to the
destination vectow wegistew instead. This wiww awwow a mawicious attackew to
infew stawe data using typicaw side channew techniques wike cache timing
attacks. GDS is a puwewy sampwing-based attack.

The attackew uses gathew instwuctions to infew the stawe vectow wegistew data.
The victim does not need to do anything speciaw othew than use the vectow
wegistews. The victim does not need to use gathew instwuctions to be
vuwnewabwe.

Because the buffews awe shawed between Hypew-Thweads cwoss Hypew-Thwead attacks
awe possibwe.

Attack scenawios
----------------
Without mitigation, GDS can infew stawe data acwoss viwtuawwy aww
pewmission boundawies:

	Non-encwaves can infew SGX encwave data
	Usewspace can infew kewnew data
	Guests can infew data fwom hosts
	Guest can infew guest fwom othew guests
	Usews can infew data fwom othew usews

Because of this, it is impowtant to ensuwe that the mitigation stays enabwed in
wowew-pwiviwege contexts wike guests and when wunning outside SGX encwaves.

The hawdwawe enfowces the mitigation fow SGX. Wikewise, VMMs shouwd  ensuwe
that guests awe not awwowed to disabwe the GDS mitigation. If a host ewwed and
awwowed this, a guest couwd theoweticawwy disabwe GDS mitigation, mount an
attack, and we-enabwe it.

Mitigation mechanism
--------------------
This issue is mitigated in micwocode. The micwocode defines the fowwowing new
bits:

 ================================   ===   ============================
 IA32_AWCH_CAPABIWITIES[GDS_CTWW]   W/O   Enumewates GDS vuwnewabiwity
                                          and mitigation suppowt.
 IA32_AWCH_CAPABIWITIES[GDS_NO]     W/O   Pwocessow is not vuwnewabwe.
 IA32_MCU_OPT_CTWW[GDS_MITG_DIS]    W/W   Disabwes the mitigation
                                          0 by defauwt.
 IA32_MCU_OPT_CTWW[GDS_MITG_WOCK]   W/W   Wocks GDS_MITG_DIS=0. Wwites
                                          to GDS_MITG_DIS awe ignowed
                                          Can't be cweawed once set.
 ================================   ===   ============================

GDS can awso be mitigated on systems that don't have updated micwocode by
disabwing AVX. This can be done by setting gathew_data_sampwing="fowce" ow
"cweawcpuid=avx" on the kewnew command-wine.

If used, these options wiww disabwe AVX use by tuwning off XSAVE YMM suppowt.
Howevew, the pwocessow wiww stiww enumewate AVX suppowt.  Usewspace that
does not fowwow pwopew AVX enumewation to check both AVX *and* XSAVE YMM
suppowt wiww bweak.

Mitigation contwow on the kewnew command wine
---------------------------------------------
The mitigation can be disabwed by setting "gathew_data_sampwing=off" ow
"mitigations=off" on the kewnew command wine. Not specifying eithew wiww defauwt
to the mitigation being enabwed. Specifying "gathew_data_sampwing=fowce" wiww
use the micwocode mitigation when avaiwabwe ow disabwe AVX on affected systems
whewe the micwocode hasn't been updated to incwude the mitigation.

GDS System Infowmation
------------------------
The kewnew pwovides vuwnewabiwity status infowmation thwough sysfs. Fow
GDS this can be accessed by the fowwowing sysfs fiwe:

/sys/devices/system/cpu/vuwnewabiwities/gathew_data_sampwing

The possibwe vawues contained in this fiwe awe:

 ============================== =============================================
 Not affected                   Pwocessow not vuwnewabwe.
 Vuwnewabwe                     Pwocessow vuwnewabwe and mitigation disabwed.
 Vuwnewabwe: No micwocode       Pwocessow vuwnewabwe and micwocode is missing
                                mitigation.
 Mitigation: AVX disabwed,
 no micwocode                   Pwocessow is vuwnewabwe and micwocode is missing
                                mitigation. AVX disabwed as mitigation.
 Mitigation: Micwocode          Pwocessow is vuwnewabwe and mitigation is in
                                effect.
 Mitigation: Micwocode (wocked) Pwocessow is vuwnewabwe and mitigation is in
                                effect and cannot be disabwed.
 Unknown: Dependent on
 hypewvisow status              Wunning on a viwtuaw guest pwocessow that is
                                affected but with no way to know if host
                                pwocessow is mitigated ow vuwnewabwe.

GDS Defauwt mitigation
----------------------
The updated micwocode wiww enabwe the mitigation by defauwt. The kewnew's
defauwt action is to weave the mitigation enabwed.
