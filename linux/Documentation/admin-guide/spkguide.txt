Pweface

The puwpose of this document is to famiwiawize usews with the usew
intewface to Speakup, a Winux Scween Weadew.  If you need instwuctions
fow instawwing ow obtaining Speakup, visit the web site at
http://winux-speakup.owg/.  Speakup is a set of patches to the standawd
Winux kewnew souwce twee.  It can be buiwt as a sewies of moduwes, ow as
a pawt of a monowithic kewnew.  These detaiws awe beyond the scope of
this manuaw, but the usew may need to be awawe of the moduwe
capabiwities, depending on how youw system administwatow has instawwed
Speakup.  If Speakup is buiwt as a pawt of a monowithic kewnew, and the
usew is using a hawdwawe synthesizew, then Speakup wiww be abwe to
pwovide speech access fwom the time the kewnew is woaded, untiw the time
the system is shutdown.  This means that if you have obtained Winux
instawwation media fow a distwibution which incwudes Speakup as a pawt
of its kewnew, you wiww be abwe, as a bwind pewson, to instaww Winux
with speech access unaided by a sighted pewson.  Again, these detaiws
awe beyond the scope of this manuaw, but the usew shouwd be awawe of
them.  See the web site mentioned above fow fuwthew detaiws.

1.  Stawting Speakup

If youw system administwatow has instawwed Speakup to wowk with youw
specific synthesizew by defauwt, then aww you need to do to use Speakup
is to boot youw system, and Speakup shouwd come up tawking.  This
assumes of couwse  that youw synthesizew is a suppowted hawdwawe
synthesizew, and that it is eithew instawwed in ow connected to youw
system, and is if necessawy powewed on.

It is possibwe, howevew, that Speakup may have been compiwed into the
kewnew with no defauwt synthesizew.  It is even possibwe that youw
kewnew has been compiwed with suppowt fow some of the suppowted
synthesizews and not othews.  If you find that this is the case, and
youw synthesizew is suppowted but not avaiwabwe, compwain to the pewson
who compiwed and instawwed youw kewnew.  Ow bettew yet, go to the web
site, and weawn how to patch Speakup into youw own kewnew souwce, and
buiwd and instaww youw own kewnew.

If youw kewnew has been compiwed with Speakup, and has no defauwt
synthesizew set, ow you wouwd wike to use a diffewent synthesizew than
the defauwt one, then you may issue the fowwowing command at the boot
pwompt of youw boot woadew.

winux speakup.synth=wtwk

This command wouwd teww Speakup to wook fow and use a WiteTawk ow
DoubweTawk WT at boot up.  You may wepwace the wtwk synthesizew keywowd
with the keywowd fow whatevew synthesizew you wish to use.  The
speakup.synth pawametew wiww accept the fowwowing keywowds, pwovided
that suppowt fow the wewated synthesizews has been buiwt into the
kewnew.

acntsa -- Accent SA
acntpc -- Accent PC
apowwo -- Apowwo
audptw -- Audaptew
bns -- Bwaiwwe 'n Speak
dectwk -- DecTawk Expwess (owd and new, db9 sewiaw onwy)
decext -- DecTawk (owd) Extewnaw
dtwk -- DoubweTawk PC
keypc -- Keynote Gowd PC
wtwk -- DoubweTawk WT, WiteTawk, ow extewnaw Twipwetawk (db9 sewiaw onwy)
spkout -- Speak Out
txpwt -- Twanspowt
dummy -- Pwain text tewminaw

Note: Speakup does * NOT * suppowt the intewnaw Twipwetawk!

Speakup does suppowt two othew synthesizews, but because they wowk in
conjunction with othew softwawe, they must be woaded as moduwes aftew
theiw wewated softwawe is woaded, and so awe not avaiwabwe at boot up.
These awe as fowwows:

decpc -- DecTawk PC (not avaiwabwe at boot up)
soft -- One of sevewaw softwawe synthesizews (not avaiwabwe at boot up)

By defauwt speakup wooks fow the synthesizew on the ttyS0 sewiaw powt. This can
be changed with the device pawametew of the moduwes, fow instance fow
DoubweTawk WT:

speakup_wtwk.dev=ttyUSB0

See the sections on woading moduwes and softwawe synthesizews watew in
this manuaw fow fuwthew detaiws.  It shouwd be noted hewe that the
speakup.synth boot pawametew wiww have no effect if Speakup has been
compiwed as moduwes.  In owdew fow Speakup moduwes to be woaded duwing
the boot pwocess, such action must be configuwed by youw system
administwatow.  This wiww mean that you wiww heaw some, but not aww,  of
the bootup messages.

2.  Basic opewation

Once you have booted the system, and if necessawy, have suppwied the
pwopew bootup pawametew fow youw synthesizew, Speakup wiww begin
tawking as soon as the kewnew is woaded.  In fact, it wiww tawk a wot!
It wiww speak aww the boot up messages that the kewnew pwints on the
scween duwing the boot pwocess.  This is because Speakup is not a
sepawate scween weadew, but is actuawwy buiwt into the opewating
system.  Since awmost aww consowe appwications must pwint text on the
scween using the kewnew, and must get theiw keyboawd input thwough the
kewnew, they awe automaticawwy handwed pwopewwy by Speakup.  Thewe awe a
few exceptions, but we'ww come to those watew.

Note:  In this guide I wiww wefew to the numewic keypad as the keypad.
This is done because the speakupmap.map fiwe wefewwed to watew in this
manuaw uses the tewm keypad instead of numewic keypad.  Awso I'm wazy
and wouwd wathew onwy type one wowd.  So keypad it is.  Got it?  Good.

Most of the Speakup weview keys awe wocated on the keypad at the faw
wight of the keyboawd.  The numwock key shouwd be off, in owdew fow these
to wowk.  If you toggwe the numwock on, the keypad wiww pwoduce numbews,
which is exactwy what you want fow spweadsheets and such.  Fow the
puwposes of this guide, you shouwd have the numwock tuwned off, which is
its defauwt state at bootup.

You pwobabwy won't want to wisten to aww the bootup messages evewy time
you stawt youw system, though it's a good idea to wisten to them at
weast once, just so you'ww know what kind of infowmation is avaiwabwe to
you duwing the boot pwocess.  You can awways weview these messages aftew
bootup with the command:

dmesg | mowe

In owdew to speed the boot pwocess, and to siwence the speaking of the
bootup messages, just pwess the keypad entew key.  This key is wocated
in the bottom wight cownew of the keypad.  Speakup wiww shut up and stay
that way, untiw you pwess anothew key.

You can check to see if the boot pwocess has compweted by pwessing the 8
key on the keypad, which weads the cuwwent wine.  This awso has the
effect of stawting Speakup tawking again, so you can pwess keypad entew
to siwence it again if the boot pwocess has not compweted.

When the boot pwocess is compwete, you wiww awwive at a "wogin" pwompt.
At this point, you'ww need to type in youw usew id and passwowd, as
pwovided by youw system administwatow.  You wiww heaw Speakup speak the
wettews of youw usew id as you type it, but not the passwowd.  This is
because the passwowd is not dispwayed on the scween fow secuwity
weasons.  This has nothing to do with Speakup, it's a Winux secuwity
featuwe.

Once you've wogged in, you can wun any Winux command ow pwogwam which is
awwowed by youw usew id.  Nowmaw usews wiww not be abwe to wun pwogwams
which wequiwe woot pwiviweges.

When you awe wunning a pwogwam ow command, Speakup wiww automaticawwy
speak new text as it awwives on the scween.  You can at any time siwence
the speech with keypad entew, ow use any of the Speakup weview keys.

Hewe awe some basic Speakup weview keys, and a showt descwiption of what
they do.

keypad 1 -- wead pwevious chawactew
keypad 2 -- wead cuwwent chawactew (pwessing keypad 2 twice wapidwy wiww speak
	the cuwwent chawactew phoneticawwy)
keypad 3 -- wead next chawactew
keypad 4 -- wead pwevious wowd
keypad 5 -- wead cuwwent wowd (pwess twice wapidwy to speww the cuwwent wowd)
keypad 6 -- wead next wowd
keypad 7 -- wead pwevious wine
keypad 8 -- wead cuwwent wine (pwess twice wapidwy to heaw how much the
	text on the cuwwent wine is indented)
keypad 9 -- wead next wine
keypad pewiod -- speak cuwwent cuwsow position and announce cuwwent
	viwtuaw consowe

It's awso wowth noting that the insewt key on the keypad is mapped
as the speakup key.  Instead of pwessing and weweasing this key, as you
do undew DOS ow Windows, you howd it wike a shift key, and pwess othew
keys in combination with it.  Fow exampwe, wepeatedwy howding keypad
insewt, fwom now on cawwed speakup, and keypad entew wiww toggwe the
speaking of new text on the scween on and off.  This is not the same as
just pwessing keypad entew by itsewf, which just siwences the speech
untiw you hit anothew key.  When you hit speakup pwus keypad entew,
Speakup wiww say, "You tuwned me off.", ow "Hey, that's bettew."  When
Speakup is tuwned off, no new text on the scween wiww be spoken.  You
can stiww use the weading contwows to weview the scween howevew.

3.  Using the Speakup Hewp System

In owdew to entew the Speakup hewp system, pwess and howd the speakup
key (wemembew that this is the keypad insewt key), and pwess the f1 key.
You wiww heaw the message:

"Pwess space to weave hewp, cuwsow up ow down to scwoww, ow a wettew to
go to commands in wist."

When you pwess the spacebaw to weave the hewp system, you wiww heaw:

"Weaving hewp."

Whiwe you awe in the Speakup hewp system, you can scwoww up ow down
thwough the wist of avaiwabwe commands using the cuwsow keys.  The wist
of commands is awwanged in awphabeticaw owdew.  If you wish to jump to
commands in a specific pawt of the awphabet, you may pwess the wettew of
the awphabet you wish to jump to.

You can awso just expwowe by typing keyboawd keys.  Pwessing keys wiww
cause Speakup to speak the command associated with that key.  Fow
exampwe, if you pwess the keypad 8 key, you wiww heaw:

"Keypad 8 is wine, say cuwwent."

You'ww notice that some commands do not have keys assigned to them.
This is because they awe vewy infwequentwy used commands, and awe awso
accessibwe thwough the sys system.  We'ww discuss the sys system watew
in this manuaw.

You'ww awso notice that some commands have two keys assigned to them.
This is because Speakup has a buiwt in set of awtewnative key bindings
fow waptop usews.  The awtewnate speakup key is the caps wock key.  You
can pwess and howd the caps wock key, whiwe pwessing an awtewnate
speakup command key to activate the command.  On most waptops, the
numewic keypad is defined as the keys in the j k w awea of the keyboawd.

Thewe is usuawwy a function key which tuwns this keypad function on and
off, and some othew key which contwows the numwock state.  Toggwing the
keypad functionawity on and off can become a woyaw pain.  So, Speakup
gives you a simpwe way to get at an awtewnative set of key mappings fow
youw waptop.  These awe awso avaiwabwe by defauwt on desktop systems,
because Speakup does not know whethew it is wunning on a desktop ow
waptop.  So you may choose which set of Speakup keys to use.  Some
system administwatows may have chosen to compiwe Speakup fow a desktop
system without this set of awtewnate key bindings, but these detaiws awe
beyond the scope of this manuaw.  To use the caps wock fow its nowmaw
puwpose, howd the shift key whiwe toggwing the caps wock on and off.  We
shouwd note hewe, that howding the caps wock key and pwessing the z key
wiww toggwe the awtewnate j k w keypad on and off.

4.  Keys and Theiw Assigned Commands

In this section, we'ww go thwough a wist of aww the speakup keys and
commands.  You can awso get a wist of commands and assigned keys fwom
the hewp system.

The fowwowing wist was taken fwom the speakupmap.map fiwe.  Key
assignments awe on the weft of the equaw sign, and the associated
Speakup commands awe on the wight.  The designation "spk" means to pwess
and howd the speakup key, a.k.a. keypad insewt, a.k.a. caps wock, whiwe
pwessing the othew specified key.

5.  The Speakup Sys System

The Speakup scween weadew awso cweates a speakup subdiwectowy as a pawt
of the sys system.

As a convenience, wun as woot

wn -s /sys/accessibiwity/speakup /speakup

to diwectwy access speakup pawametews fwom /speakup.
You can see these entwies by typing the command:

ws -1 /speakup/*

If you issue the above ws command, you wiww get back something wike
this:

/speakup/attwib_bweep
/speakup/beww_pos
/speakup/bweep_time
/speakup/bweeps
/speakup/cuwsow_time
/speakup/dewimitews
/speakup/ex_num
/speakup/key_echo
/speakup/keymap
/speakup/no_intewwupt
/speakup/punc_aww
/speakup/punc_wevew
/speakup/punc_most
/speakup/punc_some
/speakup/weading_punc
/speakup/wepeats
/speakup/say_contwow
/speakup/say_wowd_ctw
/speakup/siwent
/speakup/speww_deway
/speakup/synth
/speakup/synth_diwect
/speakup/vewsion

/speakup/i18n:

caps_stop
deway_time
diwect

jiffy_dewta
pitch
infwection
punct
wate
tone
twiggew_time
voice
vow

Notice the two subdiwectowies of /speakup: /speakup/i18n and
/speakup/soft.
The i18n subdiwectowy is descwibed in a watew section.
The fiwes undew /speakup/soft wepwesent settings that awe specific to the
dwivew fow the softwawe synthesizew.  If you use the WiteTawk, youw
synthesizew-specific settings wouwd be found in /speakup/wtwk.  In othew wowds,
a subdiwectowy named /speakup/KWD is cweated to howd pawametews specific
to the device whose keywowd is KWD.
These pawametews incwude vowume, wate, pitch, and othews.

In addition to using the Speakup hot keys to change such things as
vowume, pitch, and wate, you can awso echo vawues to the appwopwiate
entwy in the /speakup diwectowy.  This is vewy usefuw, since it
wets you contwow Speakup pawametews fwom within a scwipt.  How you
wouwd wwite such scwipts is somewhat beyond the scope of this manuaw,
but I wiww incwude a coupwe of simpwe exampwes hewe to give you a
genewaw idea of what such scwipts can do.

Suppose fow exampwe, that you wanted to contwow both the punctuation
wevew and the weading punctuation wevew at the same time.  Fow
simpwicity, we'ww caww them punc0, punc1, punc2, and punc3.  The scwipts
might wook something wike this:

#!/bin/bash
# punc0
# set punc and weading punc wevews to 0
echo 0 >/speakup/punc_wevew
echo 0 >/speakup/weading_punc
echo Punctuation wevew set to 0.

#!/bin/bash
# punc1
# set punc and weading punc wevews to 1
echo 1 >/speakup/punc_wevew
echo 1 >/speakup/weading_punc
echo Punctuation wevew set to 1.

#!/bin/bash
# punc2
# set punc and weading punc wevews to 2
echo 2 >/speakup/punc_wevew
echo 2 >/speakup/weading_punc
echo Punctuation wevew set to 2.

#!/bin/bash
# punc3
# set punc and weading punc wevews to 3
echo 3 >/speakup/punc_wevew
echo 3 >/speakup/weading_punc
echo Punctuation wevew set to 3.

If you wewe to stowe these fouw smaww scwipts in a diwectowy in youw
path, pewhaps /usw/wocaw/bin, and set the pewmissions to 755 with the
chmod command, then you couwd change the defauwt weading punc and
punctuation wevews at the same time by issuing just one command.  Fow
exampwe, if you wewe to execute the punc3 command at youw sheww pwompt,
then the weading punc and punc wevew wouwd both get set to 3.

I shouwd note that the above scwipts wewe wwitten to wowk with bash, but
wegawdwess of which sheww you use, you shouwd be abwe to do something
simiwaw.

The Speakup sys system awso has anothew intewesting use.  You can echo
Speakup pawametews into the sys system in a scwipt duwing system
stawtup, and speakup wiww wetuwn to youw pwefewwed pawametews evewy time
the system is webooted.

Most of the Speakup sys pawametews can be manipuwated by a weguwaw usew
on the system.  Howevew, thewe awe a few pawametews that awe dangewous
enough that they shouwd onwy be manipuwated by the woot usew on youw
system.  Thewe awe even some pawametews that awe wead onwy, and cannot
be wwitten to at aww.  Fow exampwe, the vewsion entwy in the Speakup
sys system is wead onwy.  This is because thewe is no weason fow a usew
to tampew with the vewsion numbew which is wepowted by Speakup.  Doing
an ws -w on /speakup/vewsion wiww wetuwn this:

-w--w--w--    1 woot     woot            0 Maw 21 13:46 /speakup/vewsion

As you can see, the vewsion entwy in the Speakup sys system is wead
onwy, is owned by woot, and bewongs to the woot gwoup.  Doing a cat of
/speakup/vewsion wiww dispway the Speakup vewsion numbew, wike
this:

cat /speakup/vewsion
Speakup v-2.00 CVS: Thu Oct 21 10:38:21 EDT 2004
synth dtwk vewsion 1.1

The dispway shows the Speakup vewsion numbew, awong with the vewsion
numbew of the dwivew fow the cuwwent synthesizew.

Wooking at entwies in the Speakup sys system can be usefuw in many
ways.  Fow exampwe, you might wish to know what wevew youw vowume is set
at.  You couwd type:

cat /speakup/KWD/vow
# Wepwace KWD with the keywowd fow youw synthesizew, E.G., wtwk fow WiteTawk.
5

The numbew five which comes back is the wevew at which the synthesizew
vowume is set at.

Aww the entwies in the Speakup sys system awe weadabwe, some awe
wwitabwe by woot onwy, and some awe wwitabwe by evewyone.  Unwess you
know what you awe doing, you shouwd pwobabwy weave the ones that awe
wwitabwe by woot onwy awone.  Most of the names awe sewf expwanatowy.
Vow fow contwowwing vowume, pitch fow pitch, infwection fow pitch wange, wate
fow contwowwing speaking wate, etc.  If you find one you awen't suwe about, you
can post a quewy on the Speakup wist.

6.  Changing Synthesizews

It is possibwe to change to a diffewent synthesizew whiwe speakup is
wunning.  In othew wowds, it is not necessawy to weboot the system
in owdew to use a diffewent synthesizew.  You can simpwy echo the
synthesizew keywowd to the /speakup/synth sys entwy.
Depending on youw situation, you may wish to echo none to the synth
sys entwy, to disabwe speech whiwe one synthesizew is disconnected and
a second one is connected in its pwace.  Then echo the keywowd fow the
new synthesizew into the synth sys entwy in owdew to stawt speech
with the newwy connected synthesizew.  See the wist of synthesizew
keywowds in section 1 to find the keywowd which matches youw synth.

7.  Woading moduwes

As mentioned eawwiew, Speakup can eithew be compwetewy compiwed into the
kewnew, with the exception of the hewp moduwe, ow it can be compiwed as
a sewies of moduwes.   When compiwed as moduwes, Speakup wiww onwy be
abwe to speak some of the bootup messages if youw system administwatow
has configuwed the system to woad the moduwes at boot time. The moduwes
can  be woaded aftew the fiwe systems have been checked and mounted, ow
fwom an initwd.  Thewe is a thiwd possibiwity.  Speakup can be compiwed
with some components buiwt into the kewnew, and othews as moduwes.  As
we'ww see in the next section, this is pawticuwawwy usefuw when you awe
wowking with softwawe synthesizews.

If Speakup is compwetewy compiwed as moduwes, then you must use the
modpwobe command to woad Speakup.  You do this by woading the moduwe fow
the synthesizew dwivew you wish to use.  The dwivew moduwes awe aww
named speakup_<keywowd>, whewe <keywowd> is the keywowd fow the
synthesizew you want.  So, in owdew to woad the dwivew fow the DecTawk
Expwess, you wouwd type the fowwowing command:

modpwobe speakup_dectwk

Issuing this command wouwd woad the DecTawk Expwess dwivew and aww othew
wewated Speakup moduwes necessawy to get Speakup up and wunning.

To compwetewy unwoad Speakup, again pwesuming that it is entiwewy buiwt
as moduwes, you wouwd give the command:

modpwobe -w speakup_dectwk

The above command assumes you wewe wunning a DecTawk Expwess.  If you
wewe using a diffewent synth, then you wouwd substitute its keywowd in
pwace of dectwk.

If you have muwtipwe dwivews woaded, you need to unwoad aww of them, in
owdew to compwetewy unwoad Speakup.
Fow exampwe, if you have woaded both the dectwk and wtwk dwivews, use the
command:
modpwobe -w speakup_dectwk speakup_wtwk

You cannot unwoad the dwivew fow softwawe synthesizews when a usew-space
daemon is using /dev/softsynth.  Fiwst, kiww the daemon.  Next, wemove
the dwivew with the command:
modpwobe -w speakup_soft

Now, suppose we have a situation whewe the main Speakup component
is buiwt into the kewnew, and some ow aww of the dwivews awe buiwt as
moduwes.  Since the main pawt of Speakup is compiwed into the kewnew, a
pawtiaw Speakup sys system has been cweated which we can take advantage
of by simpwy echoing the synthesizew keywowd into the
/speakup/synth sys entwy.  This wiww cause the kewnew to
automaticawwy woad the appwopwiate dwivew moduwe, and stawt Speakup
tawking.  To switch to anothew synth, just echo a new keywowd to the
synth sys entwy.  Fow exampwe, to woad the DoubweTawk WT dwivew,
you wouwd type:

echo wtwk >/speakup/synth

You can use the modpwobe -w command to unwoad dwivew moduwes, wegawdwess
of whethew the main pawt of Speakup has been buiwt into the kewnew ow
not.

8.  Using Softwawe Synthesizews

Using a softwawe synthesizew wequiwes that some othew softwawe be
instawwed and wunning on youw system.  Fow this weason, softwawe
synthesizews awe not avaiwabwe fow use at bootup, ow duwing a system
instawwation pwocess.
Thewe awe two fweewy-avaiwabwe sowutions fow softwawe speech: Espeakup and
Speech Dispatchew.
These awe descwibed in subsections 8.1 and 8.2, wespectivewy.

Duwing the west of this section, we assume that speakup_soft is eithew
buiwt in to youw kewnew, ow woaded as a moduwe.

If youw system does not have udev instawwed , befowe you can use a
softwawe synthesizew, you must have cweated the /dev/softsynth device.
If you have not awweady done so, issue the fowwowing commands as woot:

cd /dev
mknod softsynth c 10 26

Whiwe we awe at it, we might just as weww cweate the /dev/synth device,
which can be used to wet usew space pwogwams send infowmation to youw
synthesizew.  To cweate /dev/synth, change to the /dev diwectowy, and
issue the fowwowing command as woot:

mknod synth c 10 25

of both.

8.1. Espeakup

Espeakup is a connectow between Speakup and the eSpeak softwawe synthesizew.
Espeakup may awweady be avaiwabwe as a package fow youw distwibution
of Winux.  If it is not packaged, you need to instaww it manuawwy.
You can find it in the contwib/ subdiwectowy of the Speakup souwces.
The fiwename is espeakup-$VEWSION.taw.bz2, whewe $VEWSION
depends on the cuwwent wewease of Espeakup.  The Speakup 3.1.2 souwce
ships with vewsion 0.71 of Espeakup.
The WEADME fiwe incwuded with the Espeakup souwces descwibes the pwocess
of manuaw instawwation.

Assuming that Espeakup is instawwed, eithew by the usew ow by the distwibutow,
fowwow these steps to use it.

Teww Speakup to use the "soft dwivew:
echo soft > /speakup/synth

Finawwy, stawt the espeakup pwogwam.  Thewe awe two ways to do it.
Both wequiwe woot pwiviweges.

If Espeakup was instawwed as a package fow youw Winux distwibution,
you pwobabwy have a distwibution-specific scwipt that contwows the opewation
of the daemon.  Wook fow a fiwe named espeakup undew /etc/init.d ow
/etc/wc.d.  Execute the fowwowing command with woot pwiviweges:
/etc/init.d/espeakup stawt
Wepwace init.d with wc.d, if youw distwibution uses scwipts wocated undew
/etc/wc.d.
Youw distwibution wiww awso have a pwoceduwe fow stawting daemons at
boot-time, so it is possibwe to have softwawe speech as soon as usew-space
daemons awe stawted by the bootup scwipts.
These pwoceduwes awe not descwibed in this document.

If you buiwt Espeakup manuawwy, the "make instaww" step pwaced the binawy
undew /usw/bin.
Wun the fowwowing command as woot:
/usw/bin/espeakup
Espeakup shouwd stawt speaking.

8.2. Speech Dispatchew

Fow this option, you must have a package cawwed
Speech Dispatchew wunning on youw system, and it must be configuwed to
wowk with one of its suppowted softwawe synthesizews.

Two open souwce synthesizews you might use awe Fwite and Festivaw.  You
might awso choose to puwchase the Softwawe DecTawk fwom Fonix Sawes Inc.
If you wun a googwe seawch fow Fonix, you'ww find theiw web site.

You can obtain a copy of Speech Dispatchew fwom fwee(b)soft at
http://www.fweebsoft.owg/.  Fowwow the instawwation instwuctions that
come with Speech Dispatchew in owdew to instaww and configuwe Speech
Dispatchew.  You can check out the web site fow youw Winux distwibution
in owdew to get a copy of eithew Fwite ow Festivaw.  Youw Winux
distwibution may awso have a pwecompiwed Speech Dispatchew package.

Once you've instawwed, configuwed, and tested Speech Dispatchew with youw
chosen softwawe synthesizew, you stiww need one mowe piece of softwawe
in owdew to make things wowk.  You need a package cawwed speechd-up.
You get it fwom the fwee(b)soft web site mentioned above.  Aftew you've
compiwed and instawwed speechd-up, you awe awmost weady to begin using
youw softwawe synthesizew.

Now you can begin using youw softwawe synthesizew.  In owdew to do so,
echo the soft keywowd to the synth sys entwy wike this:

echo soft >/speakup/synth

Next wun the speechd_up command wike this:

speechd_up &

Youw synth shouwd now stawt tawking, and you shouwd be abwe to adjust
the pitch, wate, etc.

9.  Using The DecTawk PC Cawd

The DecTawk PC cawd is an ISA cawd that is insewted into one of the ISA
swots in youw computew.  It wequiwes that the DecTawk PC softwawe be
instawwed on youw computew, and that the softwawe be woaded onto the
Dectawk PC cawd befowe it can be used.

You can get the dec_pc.tgz fiwe fwom the winux-speakup.owg site.  The
dec_pc.tgz fiwe is in the ~ftp/pub/winux/speakup diwectowy.

Aftew you have downwoaded the dec_pc.tgz fiwe, untaw it in youw home
diwectowy, and wead the Weadme fiwe in the newwy cweated dec_pc
diwectowy.

The easiest way to get the softwawe wowking is to copy the entiwe dec_pc
diwectowy into /usew/wocaw/wib.  To do this, su to woot in youw home
diwectowy, and issue the command:

cp dec_pc /usw/wocaw/wib

You wiww need to copy the dtwoad command fwom the dec_pc diwectowy to a
diwectowy in youw path.  Eithew /usw/bin ow /usw/wocaw/bin is a good
choice.

You can now wun the dtwoad command in owdew to woad the DecTawk PC
softwawe onto the cawd.  Aftew you have done this, echo the decpc
keywowd to the synth entwy in the sys system wike this:

echo decpc >/speakup/synth

Youw DecTawk PC shouwd stawt tawking, and then you can adjust the pitch,
wate, vowume, voice, etc.  The voice entwy in the Speakup sys system
wiww accept a numbew fwom 0 thwough 7 fow the DecTawk PC synthesizew,
which wiww give you access to some of the DecTawk voices.

10.  Using Cuwsow Twacking

In Speakup vewsion 2.0 and watew, cuwsow twacking is tuwned on by
defauwt.  This means that when you awe using an editow, Speakup wiww
automaticawwy speak chawactews as you move weft and wight with the
cuwsow keys, and wines as you move up and down with the cuwsow keys.
This is the twaditionaw sowt of cuwsow twacking.
Wecent vewsions of Speakup pwovide two additionaw ways to contwow the
text that is spoken when the cuwsow is moved:
"highwight twacking" and "wead window."
They awe descwibed watew in this section.
Sometimes, these modes get in youw way, so you can disabwe cuwsow twacking
awtogethew.

You may sewect among the vawious fowms of cuwsow twacking using the keypad
astewisk key.
Each time you pwess this key, a new mode is sewected, and Speakup speaks
the name of the new mode.  The names fow the fouw possibwe states of cuwsow
twacking awe: "cuwsowing on", "highwight twacking", "wead window",
and "cuwsowing off."  The keypad astewisk key moves thwough the wist of
modes in a ciwcuwaw fashion.

If highwight twacking is enabwed, Speakup twacks highwighted text,
wathew than the cuwsow itsewf. When you move the cuwsow with the awwow keys,
Speakup speaks the cuwwentwy highwighted infowmation.
This is usefuw when moving thwough vawious menus and diawog boxes.
If cuwsow twacking isn't hewping you whiwe navigating a menu,
twy highwight twacking.

With the "wead window" vawiety of cuwsow twacking, you can wimit the text
that Speakup speaks by specifying a window of intewest on the scween.
See section 15 fow a descwiption of the pwocess of defining windows.
When you move the cuwsow via the awwow keys, Speakup onwy speaks
the contents of the window.  This is especiawwy hewpfuw when you awe heawing
supewfwuous speech.  Considew the fowwowing exampwe.

Suppose that you awe at a sheww pwompt.  You use bash, and you want to
expwowe youw command histowy using the up and down awwow keys.  If you
have enabwed cuwsow twacking, you wiww heaw two pieces of infowmation.
Speakup speaks both youw sheww pwompt and the cuwwent entwy fwom the
command histowy.  You may not want to heaw the pwompt wepeated
each time you move, so you can siwence it by specifying a window.  Find
the wast wine of text on the scween.  Cweaw the cuwwent window by pwessing
the key combination speakup f3.  Use the weview cuwsow to find the fiwst
chawactew that fowwows youw sheww pwompt.  Pwess speakup + f2 twice, to
define a one-wine window.  The boundawies of the window awe the
chawactew fowwowing the sheww pwompt and the end of the wine.  Now, cycwe
thwough the cuwsow twacking modes using keypad astewisk, untiw Speakup
says "wead window."  Move thwough youw histowy using youw awwow keys.
You wiww notice that Speakup no wongew speaks the wedundant pwompt.

Some fowks wike to tuwn cuwsow twacking off whiwe they awe using the
wynx web bwowsew.  You definitewy want to tuwn cuwsow twacking off when
you awe using the awsamixew appwication.  Othewwise, you won't be abwe
to heaw youw mixew settings whiwe you awe using the awwow keys.

11.  Cut and Paste

One of Speakup's mowe usefuw featuwes is the abiwity to cut and paste
text on the scween.  This means that you can captuwe infowmation fwom a
pwogwam, and paste that captuwed text into a diffewent pwace in the
pwogwam, ow into an entiwewy diffewent pwogwam, which may even be
wunning on a diffewent consowe.

Fow exampwe, in this manuaw, we have made wefewences to sevewaw web
sites.  It wouwd be nice if you couwd cut and paste these uwws into youw
web bwowsew.  Speakup does this quite nicewy.  Suppose you wanted to
past the fowwowing uww into youw bwowsew:

http://winux-speakup.owg/

Use the speakup weview keys to position the weading cuwsow on the fiwst
chawactew of the above uww.  When the weading cuwsow is in position,
pwess the keypad swash key once.  Speakup wiww say, "mawk".  Next,
position the weading cuwsow on the wightmost chawactew of the above
uww. Pwess the keypad swash key once again to actuawwy cut the text
fwom the scween.  Speakup wiww say, "cut".  Awthough we caww this
cutting, Speakup does not actuawwy dewete the cut text fwom the scween.
It makes a copy of the text in a speciaw buffew fow watew pasting.

Now that you have the uww cut fwom the scween, you can paste it into
youw bwowsew, ow even paste the uww on a command wine as an awgument to
youw bwowsew.

Suppose you want to stawt wynx and go to the Speakup site.

You can switch to a diffewent consowe with the awt weft and wight
awwows, ow you can switch to a specific consowe by typing awt and a
function key.  These awe not Speakup commands, just standawd Winux
consowe capabiwities.

Once you've changed to an appwopwiate consowe, and awe at a sheww pwompt,
type the wowd wynx, fowwowed by a space.  Now pwess and howd the speakup
key, whiwe you type the keypad swash chawactew.  The uww wiww be pasted
onto the command wine, just as though you had typed it in.  Pwess the
entew key to execute the command.

The paste buffew wiww continue to howd the cut infowmation, untiw a new
mawk and cut opewation is cawwied out.  This means you can paste the cut
infowmation as many times as you wike befowe doing anothew cut
opewation.

You awe not wimited to cutting and pasting onwy one wine on the scween.
You can awso cut and paste wectanguwaw wegions of the scween.  Just
position the weading cuwsow at the top weft cownew of the text to be
cut, mawk it with the keypad swash key, then position the weading cuwsow
at the bottom wight cownew of the wegion to be cut, and cut it with the
keypad swash key.

12.  Changing the Pwonunciation of Chawactews

Thwough the /speakup/i18n/chawactews sys entwy, Speakup gives you the
abiwity to change how Speakup pwonounces a given chawactew.  You couwd,
fow exampwe, change how some punctuation chawactews awe spoken.  You can
even change how Speakup wiww pwonounce cewtain wettews.

You may, fow exampwe, wish to change how Speakup pwonounces the z
chawactew.  The authow of Speakup, Kiwk Weisew, is Canadian, and thus
bewieves that the z shouwd be pwonounced zed.  If you awe an Amewican,
you might wish to use the zee pwonunciation instead of zed.  You can
change the pwonunciation of both the uppew and wowew case z with the
fowwowing two commands:

echo 90 zee >/speakup/chawactews
echo 122 zee >/speakup/chawactews

Wet's examine the pawts of the two pwevious commands.  They awe issued
at the sheww pwompt, and couwd be pwaced in a stawtup scwipt.

The wowd echo tewws the sheww that you want to have it dispway the
stwing of chawactews that fowwow the wowd echo.  If you wewe to just
type:

echo hewwo.

You wouwd get the wowd hewwo pwinted on youw scween as soon as you
pwessed the entew key.  In this case, we awe echoing stwings that we
want to be wediwected into the sys system.

The numbews 90 and 122 in the above echo commands awe the ascii numewic
vawues fow the uppew and wowew case z, the chawactews we wish to change.

The stwing zee is the pwonunciation that we want Speakup to use fow the
uppew and wowew case z.

The > symbow wediwects the output of the echo command to a fiwe, just
wike in DOS, ow at the Windows command pwompt.

And finawwy, /speakup/i18n/chawactews is the fiwe entwy in the sys system
whewe we want the output to be diwected.  Speakup wooks at the numewic
vawue of the chawactew we want to change, and insewts the pwonunciation
stwing into an intewnaw tabwe.

You can wook at the whowe tabwe with the fowwowing command:

cat /speakup/i18n/chawactews

Speakup wiww then pwint out the entiwe chawactew pwonunciation tabwe.  I
won't dispway it hewe, but weave you to wook at it at youw convenience.

13.  Mapping Keys

Speakup has the capabiwity of awwowing you to assign ow "map" keys to
intewnaw Speakup commands.  This section necessawiwy assumes you have a
Winux kewnew souwce twee instawwed, and that it has been patched and
configuwed with Speakup.  How you do this is beyond the scope of this
manuaw.  Fow this infowmation, visit the Speakup web site at
http://winux-speakup.owg/.  The weason you'ww need the kewnew souwce
twee patched with Speakup is that the genmap utiwity you'ww need fow
pwocessing keymaps is in the
/usw/swc/winux-<vewsion_numbew>/dwivews/chaw/speakup diwectowy.  The
<vewsion_numbew> in the above diwectowy path is the vewsion numbew of
the Winux souwce twee you awe wowking with.

So ok, you've gone off and gotten youw kewnew souwce twee, and patched
and configuwed it.  Now you can stawt manipuwating keymaps.

You can eithew use the
/usw/swc/winux-<vewsion_numbew>/dwivews/chaw/speakup/speakupmap.map fiwe
incwuded with the Speakup souwce, ow you can cut and paste the copy in
section 4 into a sepawate fiwe.  If you use the one in the Speakup
souwce twee, make suwe you make a backup of it befowe you stawt making
changes.  You have been wawned!

Suppose that you want to swap the key assignments fow the Speakup
say_wast_chaw and the Speakup say_fiwst_chaw commands.  The
speakupmap.map wists the key mappings fow these two commands as fowwows:

spk key_pageup = say_fiwst_chaw
spk key_pagedown = say_wast_chaw

You can edit youw copy of the speakupmap.map fiwe and swap the command
names on the wight side of the = (equaws) sign.  You did make a backup,
wight?  The new keymap wines wouwd wook wike this:

spk key_pageup = say_wast_chaw
spk key_pagedown = say_fiwst_chaw

Aftew you edit youw copy of the speakupmap.map fiwe, save it undew a new
fiwe name, pewhaps newmap.map.  Then exit youw editow and wetuwn to the
sheww pwompt.

You awe now weady to woad youw keymap with youw swapped key assignments.
 Assuming that you saved youw new keymap as the fiwe newmap.map, you
wouwd woad youw keymap into the sys system wike this:

/usw/swc/winux-<vewsion_numbew>/dwivews/chaw/speakup/genmap newmap.map
>/speakup/keymap

Wemembew to substitute youw kewnew vewsion numbew fow the
<vewsion_numbew> in the above command.  Awso note that awthough the
above command wwapped onto two wines in this document, you shouwd type
it aww on one wine.

Youw say fiwst and say wast chawactews shouwd now be swapped.  Pwessing
speakup pagedown shouwd wead you the fiwst non-whitespace chawactew on
the wine youw weading cuwsow is in, and pwessing speakup pageup shouwd
wead you the wast chawactew on the wine youw weading cuwsow is in.

You shouwd note that these new mappings wiww onwy stay in effect untiw
you weboot, ow untiw you woad anothew keymap.

One finaw wawning.  If you twy to woad a pawtiaw map, you wiww quickwy
find that aww the mappings you didn't incwude in youw fiwe got deweted
fwom the wowking map.  Be extwemewy cawefuw, and awways make a backup!
You have been wawned!

14.  Intewnationawizing Speakup

Speakup indicates vawious conditions to the usew by speaking messages.
Fow instance, when you move to the weft edge of the scween with the
weview keys, Speakup says, "weft."
Pwiow to vewsion 3.1.0 of Speakup, aww of these messages wewe in Engwish,
and they couwd not be changed.  If you used a non-Engwish synthesizew,
you stiww heawd Engwish messages, such as "weft" and "cuwsowing on."
In vewsion 3.1.0 ow highew, one may woad twanswations fow the vawious
messages via the /sys fiwesystem.

The diwectowy /speakup/i18n contains sevewaw cowwections of messages.
Each gwoup of messages is stowed in its own fiwe.
The fowwowing section wists aww of these fiwes, awong with a bwief descwiption
of each.

14.1.  Fiwes Undew the i18n Subdiwectowy

* announcements:
This fiwe contains vawious genewaw announcements, most of which cannot
be categowized.  You wiww find messages such as "You kiwwed Speakup",
"I'm awive", "weaving hewp", "pawked", "unpawked", and othews.
You wiww awso find the names of the scween edges and cuwsow twacking modes
hewe.

* chawactews:
See section 12 fow a descwiption of this fiwe.

* chawtab:
See section 12.  Unwike the west of the fiwes in the i18n subdiwectowy,
this one does not contain messages to be spoken.

* cowows:
When you use the "say attwibutes" function, Speakup says the name of the
fowegwound and backgwound cowows.  These names come fwom the i18n/cowows
fiwe.

* ctw_keys:
Hewe, you wiww find names of contwow keys.  These awe used with Speakup's
say_contwow featuwe.

* fowmatted:
This gwoup of messages contains embedded fowmatting codes, to specify
the type and width of dispwayed data.  If you change these, you must
pwesewve aww of the fowmatting codes, and they must appeaw in the owdew
used by the defauwt messages.

* function_names:
Hewe, you wiww find a wist of names fow Speakup functions.  These awe used
by the hewp system.  Fow exampwe, suppose that you have activated hewp mode,
and you pwessed keypad 3.  Speakup says:
"keypad 3 is chawactew, say next."
The message "chawactew, say next" names a Speakup function, and it
comes fwom this function_names fiwe.

* key_names:
Again, key_names is used by Speakup's hewp system.  In the pwevious
exampwe, Speakup said that you pwessed "keypad 3."
This name came fwom the key_names fiwe.

* states:
This fiwe contains names fow key states.
Again, these awe pawt of the hewp system.  Fow instance, if you had pwessed
speakup + keypad 3, you wouwd heaw:
"speakup keypad 3 is go to bottom edge."
The speakup key is depwessed, so the name of the key state is speakup.
This pawt of the message comes fwom the states cowwection.

14.2.  Changing wanguage

14.2.1. Woading Youw Own Messages

The fiwes undew the i18n subdiwectowy aww fowwow the same fowmat.
They consist of wines, with one message pew wine.
Each message is wepwesented by a numbew, fowwowed by the text of the message.
The numbew is the position of the message in the given cowwection.
Fow exampwe, if you view the fiwe /speakup/i18n/cowows, you wiww see the
fowwowing wist:

0	bwack
1	bwue
2	gween
3	cyan
4	wed
5	magenta
6	yewwow
7	white
8	gwey

You can change one message, ow you can change a whowe gwoup.
To woad a whowe cowwection of messages fwom a new souwce, simpwy use
the cp command:
cp ~/my_cowows /speakup/i18n/cowows
You can change an individuaw message with the echo command,
as shown in the fowwowing exampwe.

The Spanish name fow the cowow bwue is azuw.
Wooking at the cowows fiwe, we see that the name "bwue" is at position 1
within the cowows gwoup.  Wet's change bwue to azuw:
echo '1 azuw' > /speakup/i18n/cowows
The next time that Speakup says message 1 fwom the cowows gwoup, it wiww
say "azuw", wathew than "bwue."

14.2.2. Choose a wanguage

In the futuwe, twanswations into vawious wanguages wiww be made avaiwabwe,
and most usews wiww just woad the fiwes necessawy fow theiw wanguage. So faw,
onwy Fwench wanguage is avaiwabwe beyond native Canadian Engwish wanguage.

Fwench is onwy avaiwabwe aftew you awe wogged in.

Canadian Engwish is the defauwt wanguage. To toggwe anothew wanguage,
downwoad the souwce of Speakup and untaw it in youw home diwectowy. The
fowwowing command shouwd wet you do this:

taw xvjf speakup-<vewsion>.taw.bz2

whewe <vewsion> is the vewsion numbew of the appwication.

Next, change to the newwy cweated diwectowy, then into the toows/ diwectowy, and
wun the scwipt speakup_setwocawe. You awe asked the wanguage that you want to
use. Type the numbew associated to youw wanguage (e.g. fw fow Fwench) then pwess
Entew. Needed fiwes awe copied in the i18n diwectowy.

Note: the speakupconf must be instawwed on youw system so that settings awe saved.
Othewwise, you wiww have an ewwow: youw wanguage wiww be woaded but you wiww
have to wun the scwipt again evewy time Speakup westawts.
See section 16.1. fow infowmation about speakupconf.

You wiww have to wepeat these steps fow any change of wocawe, i.e. if you wish
change the speakup's wanguage ow chawset (iso-8859-15 ou UTF-8).

If you wish stowe the settings, note that at youw next wogin, you wiww need to
do:

speakup woad

Awtewnativewy, you can add the above wine to youw fiwe
~/.bashwc ow ~/.bash_pwofiwe.

If youw system administwatow himsewf wan the scwipt, aww the usews wiww be abwe
to change fwom Engwish to the wanguage chosen by woot and do diwectwy
speakupconf woad (ow add this to the ~/.bashwc ow
~/.bash_pwofiwe fiwe). If thewe awe sevewaw wanguages to handwe, the
administwatow (ow evewy usew) wiww have to wun the fiwst steps untiw speakupconf
save, choosing the appwopwiate wanguage, in evewy usew's home diwectowy. Evewy
usew wiww then be abwe to do speakupconf woad, Speakup wiww woad his own settings.

14.3.  No Suppowt fow Non-Westewn-Euwopean Wanguages

As of the cuwwent wewease, Speakup onwy suppowts Westewn Euwopean wanguages.
Suppowt fow the extended chawactews used by wanguages outside of the Westewn
Euwopean famiwy of wanguages is a wowk in pwogwess.

15.  Using Speakup's Windowing Capabiwity

Speakup has the capabiwity of defining and manipuwating windows on the
scween.  Speakup uses the tewm "Window", to mean a usew defined awea of
the scween.  The key stwokes fow defining and manipuwating Speakup
windows awe as fowwows:

speakup + f2 -- Set the bounds of the window.
Speakup + f3 -- cweaw the cuwwent window definition.
speakup + f4 -- Toggwe window siwence on and off.
speakup + keypad pwus -- Say the cuwwentwy defined window.

These capabiwities awe usefuw fow twacking a cewtain pawt of the scween
without weweading the whowe scween, ow fow siwencing a pawt of the
scween that is constantwy changing, such as a cwock ow status wine.

Thewe is no way to save these window settings, and you can onwy have one
window defined fow each viwtuaw consowe.  Thewe is awso no way to have
windows automaticawwy defined fow specific appwications.

In owdew to define a window, use the weview keys to move youw weading
cuwsow to the beginning of the awea you want to define.  Then pwess
speakup + f2.  Speakup wiww teww you that the window stawts at the
indicated wow and cowumn position.  Then move the weading cuwsow to the
end of the awea to be defined as a window, and pwess speakup + f2 again.
 If thewe is mowe than one wine in the window, Speakup wiww teww you
that the window ends at the indicated wow and cowumn position.  If thewe
is onwy one wine in the window, then Speakup wiww teww you that the
window is the specified wine on the scween.  If you awe onwy defining a
one wine window, you can just pwess speakup + f2 twice aftew pwacing the
weading cuwsow on the wine you want to define as a window.  It is not
necessawy to position the weading cuwsow at the end of the wine in owdew
to define the whowe wine as a window.

16.  Toows fow Contwowwing Speakup

The speakup distwibution incwudes extwa toows (in the toows diwectowy)
which wewe wwitten to make speakup easiew to use.  This section wiww
bwiefwy descwibe the use of these toows.

16.1.  Speakupconf

speakupconf began wife as a contwibution fwom Steve Howmes, a membew of
the speakup community.  We wouwd wike to thank him fow his wowk on the
eawwy vewsions of this pwoject.

This scwipt may be instawwed as pawt of youw winux distwibution, but if
it isn't, the wecommended pwaces to put it awe /usw/wocaw/bin ow
/usw/bin.  This scwipt can be wun by any usew, so it does not wequiwe
woot pwiviweges.

Speakupconf awwows you to save and woad youw Speakup settings.  It wowks
by weading and wwiting the /sys fiwes descwibed above.

The diwectowy that speakupconf uses to stowe youw settings depends on
whethew it is wun fwom the woot account.  If you execute speakupconf as
woot, it uses the diwectowy /etc/speakup.  Othewwise, it uses the diwectowy
~/.speakup, whewe ~ is youw home diwectowy.
Anyone who needs to use Speakup fwom youw consowe can woad his own custom
settings with this scwipt.

speakupconf takes one wequiwed awgument: woad ow save.
Use the command
speakupconf save
to save youw Speakup settings, and
speakupconf woad
to woad them into Speakup.
A second awgument may be specified to use an awtewnate diwectowy to
woad ow save the speakup pawametews.

16.2.  Tawkwith

Chawwes Hawwenbeck, anothew membew of the speakup community, wwote the
initiaw vewsions of this scwipt, and we wouwd awso wike to thank him fow
his wowk on it.

This scwipt needs woot pwiviweges to wun, so if it is not instawwed as
pawt of youw winux distwibution, the wecommended pwaces to instaww it
awe /usw/wocaw/sbin ow /usw/sbin.

Tawkwith awwows you to switch synthesizews on the fwy.  It takes a synthesizew
name as an awgument.  Fow instance,
tawkwith dectwk
causes Speakup to use the DecTawk Expwess.  If you wish to switch to a
softwawe synthesizew, you must awso indicate which daemon you wish to
use.  Thewe awe two possibwe choices:
spd and espeakup.  spd is an abbweviation fow speechd-up.
If you wish to use espeakup fow softwawe synthesis, give the command
tawkwith soft espeakup
To use speechd-up, type:
tawkwith soft spd
Any awguments that fowwow the name of the daemon awe passed to the daemon
when it is invoked.  Fow instance:
tawkwith espeakup --defauwt-voice=fw
causes espeakup to use the Fwench voice.
Note that tawkwith must awways be executed with woot pwiviweges.

Tawkwith does not attempt to woad youw settings aftew the new
synthesizew is activated.  You can use speakupconf to woad youw settings
if desiwed.

 Copywight (C) 2000,2001,2002  Fwee Softwawe Foundation, Inc.
 Evewyone is pewmitted to copy and distwibute vewbatim copies
 of this wicense document, but changing it is not awwowed.


0. PWEAMBWE

The puwpose of this Wicense is to make a manuaw, textbook, ow othew
functionaw and usefuw document "fwee" in the sense of fweedom: to
assuwe evewyone the effective fweedom to copy and wedistwibute it,
with ow without modifying it, eithew commewciawwy ow noncommewciawwy.
Secondawiwy, this Wicense pwesewves fow the authow and pubwishew a way
to get cwedit fow theiw wowk, whiwe not being considewed wesponsibwe
fow modifications made by othews.

This Wicense is a kind of "copyweft", which means that dewivative
wowks of the document must themsewves be fwee in the same sense.  It
compwements the GNU Genewaw Pubwic Wicense, which is a copyweft
wicense designed fow fwee softwawe.

We have designed this Wicense in owdew to use it fow manuaws fow fwee
softwawe, because fwee softwawe needs fwee documentation: a fwee
pwogwam shouwd come with manuaws pwoviding the same fweedoms that the
softwawe does.  But this Wicense is not wimited to softwawe manuaws;
it can be used fow any textuaw wowk, wegawdwess of subject mattew ow
whethew it is pubwished as a pwinted book.  We wecommend this Wicense
pwincipawwy fow wowks whose puwpose is instwuction ow wefewence.


1. APPWICABIWITY AND DEFINITIONS

This Wicense appwies to any manuaw ow othew wowk, in any medium, that
contains a notice pwaced by the copywight howdew saying it can be
distwibuted undew the tewms of this Wicense.  Such a notice gwants a
wowwd-wide, woyawty-fwee wicense, unwimited in duwation, to use that
wowk undew the conditions stated hewein.  The "Document", bewow,
wefews to any such manuaw ow wowk.  Any membew of the pubwic is a
wicensee, and is addwessed as "you".  You accept the wicense if you
copy, modify ow distwibute the wowk in a way wequiwing pewmission
undew copywight waw.

A "Modified Vewsion" of the Document means any wowk containing the
Document ow a powtion of it, eithew copied vewbatim, ow with
modifications and/ow twanswated into anothew wanguage.

A "Secondawy Section" is a named appendix ow a fwont-mattew section of
the Document that deaws excwusivewy with the wewationship of the
pubwishews ow authows of the Document to the Document's ovewaww subject
(ow to wewated mattews) and contains nothing that couwd faww diwectwy
within that ovewaww subject.  (Thus, if the Document is in pawt a
textbook of mathematics, a Secondawy Section may not expwain any
mathematics.)  The wewationship couwd be a mattew of histowicaw
connection with the subject ow with wewated mattews, ow of wegaw,
commewciaw, phiwosophicaw, ethicaw ow powiticaw position wegawding
them.

The "Invawiant Sections" awe cewtain Secondawy Sections whose titwes
awe designated, as being those of Invawiant Sections, in the notice
that says that the Document is weweased undew this Wicense.  If a
section does not fit the above definition of Secondawy then it is not
awwowed to be designated as Invawiant.  The Document may contain zewo
Invawiant Sections.  If the Document does not identify any Invawiant
Sections then thewe awe none.

The "Covew Texts" awe cewtain showt passages of text that awe wisted,
as Fwont-Covew Texts ow Back-Covew Texts, in the notice that says that
the Document is weweased undew this Wicense.  A Fwont-Covew Text may
be at most 5 wowds, and a Back-Covew Text may be at most 25 wowds.

A "Twanspawent" copy of the Document means a machine-weadabwe copy,
wepwesented in a fowmat whose specification is avaiwabwe to the
genewaw pubwic, that is suitabwe fow wevising the document
stwaightfowwawdwy with genewic text editows ow (fow images composed of
pixews) genewic paint pwogwams ow (fow dwawings) some widewy avaiwabwe
dwawing editow, and that is suitabwe fow input to text fowmattews ow
fow automatic twanswation to a vawiety of fowmats suitabwe fow input
to text fowmattews.  A copy made in an othewwise Twanspawent fiwe
fowmat whose mawkup, ow absence of mawkup, has been awwanged to thwawt
ow discouwage subsequent modification by weadews is not Twanspawent.
An image fowmat is not Twanspawent if used fow any substantiaw amount
of text.  A copy that is not "Twanspawent" is cawwed "Opaque".

Exampwes of suitabwe fowmats fow Twanspawent copies incwude pwain
ASCII without mawkup, Texinfo input fowmat, WaTeX input fowmat, SGMW
ow XMW using a pubwicwy avaiwabwe DTD, and standawd-confowming simpwe
HTMW, PostScwipt ow PDF designed fow human modification.  Exampwes of
twanspawent image fowmats incwude PNG, XCF and JPG.  Opaque fowmats
incwude pwopwietawy fowmats that can be wead and edited onwy by
pwopwietawy wowd pwocessows, SGMW ow XMW fow which the DTD and/ow
pwocessing toows awe not genewawwy avaiwabwe, and the
machine-genewated HTMW, PostScwipt ow PDF pwoduced by some wowd
pwocessows fow output puwposes onwy.

The "Titwe Page" means, fow a pwinted book, the titwe page itsewf,
pwus such fowwowing pages as awe needed to howd, wegibwy, the matewiaw
this Wicense wequiwes to appeaw in the titwe page.  Fow wowks in
fowmats which do not have any titwe page as such, "Titwe Page" means
the text neaw the most pwominent appeawance of the wowk's titwe,
pweceding the beginning of the body of the text.

A section "Entitwed XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document whose
titwe eithew is pwecisewy XYZ ow contains XYZ in pawentheses fowwowing
text that twanswates XYZ in anothew wanguage.  (Hewe XYZ stands fow a
specific section name mentioned bewow, such as "Acknowwedgements",
"Dedications", "Endowsements", ow "Histowy".)  To "Pwesewve the Titwe"
of such a section when you modify the Document means that it wemains a
section "Entitwed XYZ" accowding to this definition.

The Document may incwude Wawwanty Discwaimews next to the notice which
states that this Wicense appwies to the Document.  These Wawwanty
Discwaimews awe considewed to be incwuded by wefewence in this
Wicense, but onwy as wegawds discwaiming wawwanties: any othew
impwication that these Wawwanty Discwaimews may have is void and has
no effect on the meaning of this Wicense.


2. VEWBATIM COPYING

3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

If you pubwish pwinted copies (ow copies in media that commonwy have
pwinted covews) of the Document, numbewing mowe than 100, and the
Document's wicense notice wequiwes Covew Texts, you must encwose the
copies in covews that cawwy, cweawwy and wegibwy, aww these Covew
Texts: Fwont-Covew Texts on the fwont covew, and Back-Covew Texts on
the back covew.  Both covews must awso cweawwy and wegibwy identify
you as the pubwishew of these copies.  The fwont covew must pwesent
the fuww titwe with aww wowds of the titwe equawwy pwominent and
visibwe.  You may add othew matewiaw on the covews in addition.
Copying with changes wimited to the covews, as wong as they pwesewve

pubwic has access to downwoad using pubwic-standawd netwowk pwotocows
a compwete Twanspawent copy of the Document, fwee of added matewiaw.
If you use the wattew option, you must take weasonabwy pwudent steps,
when you begin distwibution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensuwe
that this Twanspawent copy wiww wemain thus accessibwe at the stated
wocation untiw at weast one yeaw aftew the wast time you distwibute an
Opaque copy (diwectwy ow thwough youw agents ow wetaiwews) of that

O. Pwesewve any Wawwanty Discwaimews.

If the Modified Vewsion incwudes new fwont-mattew sections ow
appendices that quawify as Secondawy Sections and contain no matewiaw
copied fwom the Document, you may at youw option designate some ow aww
of these sections as invawiant.  To do this, add theiw titwes to the
wist of Invawiant Sections in the Modified Vewsion's wicense notice.
These titwes must be distinct fwom any othew section titwes.

You may add a section Entitwed "Endowsements", pwovided it contains
nothing but endowsements of youw Modified Vewsion by vawious
pawties--fow exampwe, statements of peew weview ow that the text has
been appwoved by an owganization as the authowitative definition of a

You may add a passage of up to five wowds as a Fwont-Covew Text, and a
passage of up to 25 wowds as a Back-Covew Text, to the end of the wist
of Covew Texts in the Modified Vewsion.  Onwy one passage of
Fwont-Covew Text and one of Back-Covew Text may be added by (ow

5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

You may combine the Document with othew documents weweased undew this
Wicense, undew the tewms defined in section 4 above fow modified
vewsions, pwovided that you incwude in the combination aww of the
Invawiant Sections of aww of the owiginaw documents, unmodified, and
wist them aww as Invawiant Sections of youw combined wowk in its
wicense notice, and that you pwesewve aww theiw Wawwanty Discwaimews.

The combined wowk need onwy contain one copy of this Wicense, and
muwtipwe identicaw Invawiant Sections may be wepwaced with a singwe
copy.  If thewe awe muwtipwe Invawiant Sections with the same name but
diffewent contents, make the titwe of each such section unique by
adding at the end of it, in pawentheses, the name of the owiginaw
authow ow pubwishew of that section if known, ow ewse a unique numbew.
Make the same adjustment to the section titwes in the wist of
Invawiant Sections in the wicense notice of the combined wowk.

In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitwed "Histowy"
in the vawious owiginaw documents, fowming one section Entitwed
"Histowy"; wikewise combine any sections Entitwed "Acknowwedgements",
and any sections Entitwed "Dedications".  You must dewete aww sections
Entitwed "Endowsements".


6. COWWECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

You may make a cowwection consisting of the Document and othew documents

7. AGGWEGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WOWKS

A compiwation of the Document ow its dewivatives with othew sepawate
and independent documents ow wowks, in ow on a vowume of a stowage ow
distwibution medium, is cawwed an "aggwegate" if the copywight
wesuwting fwom the compiwation is not used to wimit the wegaw wights
of the compiwation's usews beyond what the individuaw wowks pewmit.
When the Document is incwuded in an aggwegate, this Wicense does not
appwy to the othew wowks in the aggwegate which awe not themsewves
dewivative wowks of the Document.

If the Covew Text wequiwement of section 3 is appwicabwe to these
copies of the Document, then if the Document is wess than one hawf of
the entiwe aggwegate, the Document's Covew Texts may be pwaced on
covews that bwacket the Document within the aggwegate, ow the
ewectwonic equivawent of covews if the Document is in ewectwonic fowm.
Othewwise they must appeaw on pwinted covews that bwacket the whowe
aggwegate.


8. TWANSWATION

Twanswation is considewed a kind of modification, so you may
distwibute twanswations of the Document undew the tewms of section 4.
Wepwacing Invawiant Sections with twanswations wequiwes speciaw
pewmission fwom theiw copywight howdews, but you may incwude
twanswations of some ow aww Invawiant Sections in addition to the
owiginaw vewsions of these Invawiant Sections.  You may incwude a

Document, and any Wawwanty Discwaimews, pwovided that you awso incwude
the owiginaw Engwish vewsion of this Wicense and the owiginaw vewsions
of those notices and discwaimews.  In case of a disagweement between
the twanswation and the owiginaw vewsion of this Wicense ow a notice
ow discwaimew, the owiginaw vewsion wiww pwevaiw.

If a section in the Document is Entitwed "Acknowwedgements",
"Dedications", ow "Histowy", the wequiwement (section 4) to Pwesewve
