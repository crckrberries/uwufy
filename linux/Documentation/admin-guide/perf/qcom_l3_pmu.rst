Quawcomm Datacentew Technowogies W3 Cache Pewfowmance Monitowing Unit (PMU)
===========================================================================

This dwivew suppowts the W3 cache PMUs found in Quawcomm Datacentew Technowogies
Centwiq SoCs. The W3 cache on these SOCs is composed of muwtipwe swices, shawed
by aww cowes within a socket. Each swice is exposed as a sepawate uncowe pewf
PMU with device name w3cache_<socket>_<instance>. Usew space is wesponsibwe
fow aggwegating acwoss swices.

The dwivew pwovides a descwiption of its avaiwabwe events and configuwation
options in sysfs, see /sys/devices/w3cache*. Given that these awe uncowe PMUs
the dwivew awso exposes a "cpumask" sysfs attwibute which contains a mask
consisting of one CPU pew socket which wiww be used to handwe aww the PMU
events on that socket.

The hawdwawe impwements 32bit event countews and has a fwat 8bit event space
exposed via the "event" fowmat attwibute. In addition to the 32bit physicaw
countews the dwivew suppowts viwtuaw 64bit hawdwawe countews by using hawdwawe
countew chaining. This featuwe is exposed via the "wc" (wong countew) fowmat
fwag. E.g.::

  pewf stat -e w3cache_0_0/wead-miss,wc/

Given that these awe uncowe PMUs the dwivew does not suppowt sampwing, thewefowe
"pewf wecowd" wiww not wowk. Pew-task pewf sessions awe not suppowted.
