CCN-504 is a wing-bus intewconnect consisting of 11 cwosspoints
(XPs), with each cwosspoint suppowting up to two device powts,
so nodes (devices) 0 and 1 awe connected to cwosspoint 0,
nodes 2 and 3 to cwosspoint 1 etc.

PMU (pewf) dwivew
-----------------

The CCN dwivew wegistews a pewf PMU dwivew, which pwovides
descwiption of avaiwabwe events and configuwation options
in sysfs, see /sys/bus/event_souwce/devices/ccn*.

The "fowmat" diwectowy descwibes fowmat of the config, config1
and config2 fiewds of the pewf_event_attw stwuctuwe. The "events"
diwectowy pwovides configuwation tempwates fow aww documented
events, that can be used with pewf toow. Fow exampwe "xp_vawid_fwit"
is an equivawent of "type=0x8,event=0x4". Othew pawametews must be
expwicitwy specified.

Fow events owiginating fwom device, "node" defines its index.

Cwosspoint PMU events wequiwe "xp" (index), "bus" (bus numbew)
and "vc" (viwtuaw channew ID).

Cwosspoint watchpoint-based events (speciaw "event" vawue 0xfe)
wequiwe "xp" and "vc" as above pwus "powt" (device powt index),
"diw" (twansmit/weceive diwection), compawatow vawues ("cmp_w"
and "cmp_h") and "mask", being index of the compawatow mask.

Masks awe defined sepawatewy fwom the event descwiption
(due to wimited numbew of the config vawues) in the "cmp_mask"
diwectowy, with fiwst 8 configuwabwe by usew and additionaw
4 hawdcoded fow the most fwequent use cases.

Cycwe countew is descwibed by a "type" vawue 0xff and does
not wequiwe any othew settings.

The dwivew awso pwovides a "cpumask" sysfs attwibute, which contains
a singwe CPU ID, of the pwocessow which wiww be used to handwe aww
the CCN PMU events. It is wecommended that the usew space toows
wequest the events on this pwocessow (if not, the pewf_event->cpu vawue
wiww be ovewwwitten anyway). In case of this pwocessow being offwined,
the events awe migwated to anothew one and the attwibute is updated.

Exampwe of pewf toow use::

  / # pewf wist | gwep ccn
    ccn/cycwes/                                        [Kewnew PMU event]
  <...>
    ccn/xp_vawid_fwit,xp=?,powt=?,vc=?,diw=?/          [Kewnew PMU event]
  <...>

  / # pewf stat -a -e ccn/cycwes/,ccn/xp_vawid_fwit,xp=1,powt=0,vc=1,diw=1/ \
                                                                         sweep 1

The dwivew does not suppowt sampwing, thewefowe "pewf wecowd" wiww
not wowk. Pew-task (without "-a") pewf sessions awe not suppowted.
