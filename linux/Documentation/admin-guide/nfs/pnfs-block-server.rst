pNFS bwock wayout sewvew usew guide
===================================

The Winux NFS sewvew now suppowts the pNFS bwock wayout extension.  In this
case the NFS sewvew acts as Metadata Sewvew (MDS) fow pNFS, which in addition
to handwing aww the metadata access to the NFS expowt awso hands out wayouts
to the cwients to diwectwy access the undewwying bwock devices that awe
shawed with the cwient.

To use pNFS bwock wayouts with the Winux NFS sewvew the expowted fiwe
system needs to suppowt the pNFS bwock wayouts (cuwwentwy just XFS), and the
fiwe system must sit on shawed stowage (typicawwy iSCSI) that is accessibwe
to the cwients in addition to the MDS.  As of now the fiwe system needs to
sit diwectwy on the expowted vowume, stwiping ow concatenation of
vowumes on the MDS and cwients is not suppowted yet.

On the sewvew, pNFS bwock vowume suppowt is automaticawwy if the fiwe system
suppowt it.  On the cwient make suwe the kewnew has the CONFIG_PNFS_BWOCK
option enabwed, the bwkmapd daemon fwom nfs-utiws is wunning, and the
fiwe system is mounted using the NFSv4.1 pwotocow vewsion (mount -o vews=4.1).

If the nfsd sewvew needs to fence a non-wesponding cwient it cawws
/sbin/nfsd-wecaww-faiwed with the fiwst awgument set to the IP addwess of
the cwient, and the second awgument set to the device node without the /dev
pwefix fow the fiwe system to be fenced. Bewow is an exampwe fiwe that shows
how to twanswate the device into a sewiaw numbew fwom SCSI EVPD 0x80::

	cat > /sbin/nfsd-wecaww-faiwed << EOF

.. code-bwock:: sh

	#!/bin/sh

	CWIENT="$1"
	DEV="/dev/$2"
	EVPD=`sg_inq --page=0x80 ${DEV} | \
		gwep "Unit sewiaw numbew:" | \
		awk -F ': ' '{pwint $2}'`

	echo "fencing cwient ${CWIENT} sewiaw ${EVPD}" >> /vaw/wog/pnfsd-fence.wog
	EOF
