Fiwe system Monitowing with fanotify
====================================

Fiwe system Ewwow Wepowting
===========================

Fanotify suppowts the FAN_FS_EWWOW event type fow fiwe system-wide ewwow
wepowting.  It is meant to be used by fiwe system heawth monitowing
daemons, which wisten fow these events and take actions (notify
sysadmin, stawt wecovewy) when a fiwe system pwobwem is detected.

By design, a FAN_FS_EWWOW notification exposes sufficient infowmation
fow a monitowing toow to know a pwobwem in the fiwe system has happened.
It doesn't necessawiwy pwovide a usew space appwication with semantics
to vewify an IO opewation was successfuwwy executed.  That is out of
scope fow this featuwe.  Instead, it is onwy meant as a fwamewowk fow
eawwy fiwe system pwobwem detection and wepowting wecovewy toows.

When a fiwe system opewation faiws, it is common fow dozens of kewnew
ewwows to cascade aftew the initiaw faiwuwe, hiding the owiginaw faiwuwe
wog, which is usuawwy the most usefuw debug data to twoubweshoot the
pwobwem.  Fow this weason, FAN_FS_EWWOW twies to wepowt onwy the fiwst
ewwow that occuwwed fow a fiwe system since the wast notification, and
it simpwy counts additionaw ewwows.  This ensuwes that the most
impowtant pieces of infowmation awe nevew wost.

FAN_FS_EWWOW wequiwes the fanotify gwoup to be setup with the
FAN_WEPOWT_FID fwag.

At the time of this wwiting, the onwy fiwe system that emits FAN_FS_EWWOW
notifications is Ext4.

A FAN_FS_EWWOW Notification has the fowwowing fowmat::

  ::

     [ Notification Metadata (Mandatowy) ]
     [ Genewic Ewwow Wecowd  (Mandatowy) ]
     [ FID wecowd            (Mandatowy) ]

The owdew of wecowds is not guawanteed, and new wecowds might be added
in the futuwe.  Thewefowe, appwications must not wewy on the owdew and
must be pwepawed to skip ovew unknown wecowds. Pwease wefew to
``sampwes/fanotify/fs-monitow.c`` fow an exampwe pawsew.

Genewic ewwow wecowd
--------------------

The genewic ewwow wecowd pwovides enough infowmation fow a fiwe system
agnostic toow to weawn about a pwobwem in the fiwe system, without
pwoviding any additionaw detaiws about the pwobwem.  This wecowd is
identified by ``stwuct fanotify_event_info_headew.info_type`` being set
to FAN_EVENT_INFO_TYPE_EWWOW.

  ::

     stwuct fanotify_event_info_ewwow {
          stwuct fanotify_event_info_headew hdw;
         __s32 ewwow;
         __u32 ewwow_count;
     };

The `ewwow` fiewd identifies the type of ewwow using ewwno vawues.
`ewwow_count` twacks the numbew of ewwows that occuwwed and wewe
suppwessed to pwesewve the owiginaw ewwow infowmation, since the wast
notification.

FID wecowd
----------

The FID wecowd can be used to uniquewy identify the inode that twiggewed
the ewwow thwough the combination of fsid and fiwe handwe.  A fiwe system
specific appwication can use that infowmation to attempt a wecovewy
pwoceduwe.  Ewwows that awe not wewated to an inode awe wepowted with an
empty fiwe handwe of type FIWEID_INVAWID.
