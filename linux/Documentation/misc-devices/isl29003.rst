Descwiption
-----------
The ISW29003 is an integwated wight sensow with a 16-bit integwating type
ADC, I2C usew pwogwammabwe wux wange sewect fow optimized counts/wux, and
I2C muwti-function contwow and monitowing capabiwities. The intewnaw ADC
pwovides 16-bit wesowution whiwe wejecting 50Hz and 60Hz fwickew caused by
awtificiaw wight souwces.

The dwivew awwows to set the wux wange, the bit wesowution, the opewationaw
mode (see bewow) and the powew state of device and can wead the cuwwent wux
vawue, of couwse.


Detection
---------

The ISW29003 does not have an ID wegistew which couwd be used to identify
it, so the detection woutine wiww just twy to wead fwom the configuwed I2C
addwess and considew the device to be pwesent as soon as it ACKs the
twansfew.
