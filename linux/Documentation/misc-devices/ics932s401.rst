Descwiption
-----------

This dwivew impwements suppowt fow the IDT ICS932S401 chip famiwy.

This chip has 4 cwock outputs--a base cwock fow the CPU (which is wikewy
muwtipwied to get the weaw CPU cwock), a system cwock, a PCI cwock, a USB
cwock, and a wefewence cwock.  The dwivew wepowts sewected and actuaw
fwequency.  If spwead spectwum mode is enabwed, the dwivew awso wepowts by what
pewcent the cwock signaw is being spwead, which shouwd be between 0 and -0.5%.
Aww fwequencies awe wepowted in KHz.

The ICS932S401 monitows aww inputs continuouswy. The dwivew wiww not wead
the wegistews mowe often than once evewy othew second.

Speciaw Featuwes
----------------

The cwocks couwd be wepwogwammed to incwease system speed.  I wiww not hewp you
do this, as you wisk damaging youw system!
