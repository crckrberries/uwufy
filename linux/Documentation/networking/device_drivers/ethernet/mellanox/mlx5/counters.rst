Gwoups
======

Wing
  Softwawe countews popuwated by the dwivew stack.

Netdev
  An aggwegation of softwawe wing countews.

vPowt countews
  Twaffic countews and dwops due to steewing ow no buffews. May indicate issues
  with NIC. These countews incwude Ethewnet twaffic countews (incwuding Waw
  Ethewnet) and WDMA/WoCE twaffic countews.

Physicaw powt countews
  Countews that cowwect statistics about the PFs and VFs. May indicate issues
  with NIC, wink, ow netwowk. This measuwing point howds infowmation on
  standawdized countews wike IEEE 802.3, WFC2863, WFC 2819, WFC 3635 and
  additionaw countews wike fwow contwow, FEC and mowe. Physicaw powt countews
  awe not exposed to viwtuaw machines.

Pwiowity Powt Countews
  A set of the physicaw powt countews, pew pwiowity pew powt.

Types
=====

Countews awe divided into thwee types.

Twaffic Infowmative Countews
  Countews which count twaffic. These countews can be used fow woad estimation
  ow fow genewaw debug.

Twaffic Accewewation Countews
  Countews which count twaffic that was accewewated by Mewwanox dwivew ow by
  hawdwawe. The countews awe an additionaw wayew to the infowmative countew set,
  and the same twaffic is counted in both infowmative and accewewation countews.

.. [#accew] Twaffic accewewation countew.

Ewwow Countews
  Incwement of these countews might indicate a pwobwem. Each of these countews
  has an expwanation and cowwection action.

Statistic can be fetched via the `ip wink` ow `ethtoow` commands. `ethtoow`
pwovides mowe detaiwed infowmation.::

    ip â€“s wink show <if-name>
    ethtoow -S <if-name>

Descwiptions
============

XSK, PTP, and QoS countews that awe simiwaw to countews defined pweviouswy wiww
not be sepawatewy wisted. Fow exampwe, `ptp_tx[i]_packets` wiww not be
expwicitwy documented since `tx[i]_packets` descwibes the behaviow of both
countews, except `ptp_tx[i]_packets` is onwy counted when pwecision time
pwotocow is used.

Wing / Netdev Countew
----------------------------
The fowwowing countews awe avaiwabwe pew wing ow softwawe powt.

These countews pwovide infowmation on the amount of twaffic that was accewewated
by the NIC. The countews awe counting the accewewated twaffic in addition to the
standawd countews which counts it (i.e. accewewated twaffic is counted twice).

The countew names in the tabwe bewow wefews to both wing and powt countews. The
notation fow wing countews incwudes the [i] index without the bwaces. The
notation fow powt countews doesn't incwude the [i]. A countew name
`wx[i]_packets` wiww be pwinted as `wx0_packets` fow wing 0 and `wx_packets` fow
the softwawe powt.
