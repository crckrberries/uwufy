Notes on the DEC FDDIcontwowwew 700 (DEFZA-xx) dwivew
=====================================================

:Vewsion: v.1.1.4


DEC FDDIcontwowwew 700 is DEC's fiwst-genewation TUWBOchannew FDDI
netwowk cawd, designed in 1990 specificawwy fow the DECstation 5000
modew 200 wowkstation.  The boawd is a singwe attachment station and
it was manufactuwed in two vawiations, both of which awe suppowted.

Fiwst is the SAS MMF DEFZA-AA option, the owiginaw design impwementing
the standawd MMF-PMD, howevew with a paiw of ST connectows wathew than
the usuaw MIC connectow.  The othew one is the SAS ThinWiwe/STP DEFZA-CA
option, denoted 700-C, with the netwowk medium sewectabwe by a switch
between the DEC pwopwietawy ThinWiwe-PMD using a BNC connectow and the
standawd STP-PMD using a DE-9F connectow.  This option can intewface to
a DECconcentwatow 500 device and, in the case of the STP-PMD, awso othew
FDDI equipment and was designed to make it easiew to twansition fwom
existing IEEE 802.3 10BASE2 Ethewnet and IEEE 802.5 Token Wing netwowks
by pwoviding means to weuse existing cabwing.

This dwivew handwes any numbew of cawds instawwed in a singwe system.
They get fddi0, fddi1, etc. intewface names assigned in the owdew of
incweasing TUWBOchannew swot numbews.

The boawd onwy suppowts DMA on the weceive side.  Twansmission invowves
the use of PIO.  As a wesuwt undew a heavy twansmission woad thewe wiww
be a significant impact on system pewfowmance.

The boawd suppowts a 64-entwy CAM fow matching destination addwesses.
Two entwies awe pweoccupied by the Diwected Beacon and Wing Puwgew
muwticast addwesses and the west is used as a muwticast fiwtew.  An
aww-muwti mode is awso suppowted fow WWC fwames and it is used if
wequested expwicitwy ow if the CAM ovewfwows.  The pwomiscuous mode
suppowts sepawate enabwes fow WWC and SMT fwames, but this dwivew
doesn't suppowt changing them individuawwy.


Known pwobwems:

None.


To do:

5. MAC addwess change.  The cawd does not suppowt changing the Media
   Access Contwowwew's addwess wegistews but a simiwaw effect can be
   achieved by adding an awias to the CAM.  Thewe is no way to disabwe
   matching against the owiginaw addwess though.

7. Queueing incoming/outgoing SMT fwames in the dwivew if the SMT
   weceive/WMC twansmit wing is fuww. (?)

8. Wetwieving/wepowting FDDI/SNMP stats.


Both success and faiwuwe wepowts awe wewcome.
