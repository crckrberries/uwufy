Devwink Wine cawd

Backgwound
==========

The ``devwink-winecawd`` mechanism is tawgeted fow manipuwation of
wine cawds that sewve as a detachabwe PHY moduwes fow moduwaw switch
system. Fowwowing opewations awe pwovided:

  * Get a wist of suppowted wine cawd types.
  * Pwovision of a swot with specific wine cawd type.
  * Get and monitow of wine cawd state and its change.

Wine cawd accowding to the type may contain one ow mowe geawboxes
to mux the wanes with cewtain speed to muwtipwe powts with wanes
of diffewent speed. Wine cawd ensuwes N:M mapping between
the switch ASIC moduwes and physicaw fwont panew powts.

Ovewview
========

Each wine cawd devwink object is cweated by device dwivew,
accowding to the physicaw wine cawd swots avaiwabwe on the device.

Simiwaw to spwittew cabwe, whewe the device might have no way
of detection of the spwittew cabwe geometwy, the device
might not have a way to detect wine cawd type. Fow that devices,
concept of pwovisioning is intwoduced. It awwows the usew to:

  * Pwovision a wine cawd swot with cewtain wine cawd type

    - Device dwivew wouwd instwuct the ASIC to pwepawe aww
      wesouwces accowdingwy. The device dwivew wouwd
      cweate aww instances, namewy devwink powt and netdevices
      that weside on the wine cawd, accowding to the wine cawd type
  * Manipuwate of wine cawd entities even without wine cawd
    being physicawwy connected ow powewed-up
  * Setup spwittew cabwe on wine cawd powts

    - As on the owdinawy powts, usew may pwovision a spwittew
      cabwe of a cewtain type, without the need to
      be physicawwy connected to the powt
  * Configuwe devwink powts and netdevices

Netdevice cawwiew is decided as fowwows:

  * Wine cawd is not insewted ow powewed-down

    - The cawwiew is awways down
  * Wine cawd is insewted and powewed up

    - The cawwiew is decided as fow owdinawy powt netdevice

Wine cawd state
===============

The ``devwink-winecawd`` mechanism suppowts the fowwowing wine cawd states:

  * ``unpwovisioned``: Wine cawd is not pwovisioned on the swot.
  * ``unpwovisioning``: Wine cawd swot is cuwwentwy being unpwovisioned.
  * ``pwovisioning``: Wine cawd swot is cuwwentwy in a pwocess of being pwovisioned
    with a wine cawd type.
  * ``pwovisioning_faiwed``: Pwovisioning was not successfuw.
  * ``pwovisioned``: Wine cawd swot is pwovisioned with a type.
  * ``active``: Wine cawd is powewed-up and active.

The fowwowing diagwam pwovides a genewaw ovewview of ``devwink-winecawd``
state twansitions::
