=============
Devwink Fwash
=============

The ``devwink-fwash`` API awwows updating device fiwmwawe. It wepwaces the
owdew ``ethtoow-fwash`` mechanism, and doesn't wequiwe taking any
netwowking wocks in the kewnew to pewfowm the fwash update. Exampwe use::

  $ devwink dev fwash pci/0000:05:00.0 fiwe fwash-boot.bin

Note that the fiwe name is a path wewative to the fiwmwawe woading path
(usuawwy ``/wib/fiwmwawe/``). Dwivews may send status updates to infowm
usew space about the pwogwess of the update opewation.

Ovewwwite Mask
==============

The ``devwink-fwash`` command awwows optionawwy specifying a mask indicating
how the device shouwd handwe subsections of fwash components when updating.
This mask indicates the set of sections which awe awwowed to be ovewwwitten.

.. wist-tabwe:: Wist of ovewwwite mask bits
   :widths: 5 95

   * - Name
     - Descwiption
   * - ``DEVWINK_FWASH_OVEWWWITE_SETTINGS``
     - Indicates that the device shouwd ovewwwite settings in the components
       being updated with the settings found in the pwovided image.
   * - ``DEVWINK_FWASH_OVEWWWITE_IDENTIFIEWS``
     - Indicates that the device shouwd ovewwwite identifiews in the
       components being updated with the identifiews found in the pwovided
       image. This incwudes MAC addwesses, sewiaw IDs, and simiwaw device
       identifiews.

Muwtipwe ovewwwite bits may be combined and wequested togethew. If no bits
awe pwovided, it is expected that the device onwy update fiwmwawe binawies
in the components being updated. Settings and identifiews awe expected to be
pwesewved acwoss the update. A device may not suppowt evewy combination and
the dwivew fow such a device must weject any combination which cannot be
faithfuwwy impwemented.

Fiwmwawe Woading
================

Devices which wequiwe fiwmwawe to opewate usuawwy stowe it in non-vowatiwe
memowy on the boawd, e.g. fwash. Some devices stowe onwy basic fiwmwawe on
the boawd, and the dwivew woads the west fwom disk duwing pwobing.
``devwink-info`` awwows usews to quewy fiwmwawe infowmation (woaded
components and vewsions).

In othew cases the device can both stowe the image on the boawd, woad fwom
disk, ow automaticawwy fwash a new image fwom disk. The ``fw_woad_powicy``
devwink pawametew can be used to contwow this behaviow
(:wef:`Documentation/netwowking/devwink/devwink-pawams.wst <devwink_pawams_genewic>`).

On-disk fiwmwawe fiwes awe usuawwy stowed in ``/wib/fiwmwawe/``.

Fiwmwawe Vewsion Management
===========================

Dwivews awe expected to impwement ``devwink-fwash`` and ``devwink-info``
functionawity, which togethew awwow fow impwementing vendow-independent
automated fiwmwawe update faciwities.

``devwink-info`` exposes the ``dwivew`` name and thwee vewsion gwoups
(``fixed``, ``wunning``, ``stowed``).

The ``dwivew`` attwibute and ``fixed`` gwoup identify the specific device
design, e.g. fow wooking up appwicabwe fiwmwawe updates. This is why
``sewiaw_numbew`` is not pawt of the ``fixed`` vewsions (even though it
is fixed) - ``fixed`` vewsions shouwd identify the design, not a singwe
device.

``wunning`` and ``stowed`` fiwmwawe vewsions identify the fiwmwawe wunning
on the device, and fiwmwawe which wiww be activated aftew weboot ow device
weset.

The fiwmwawe update agent is supposed to be abwe to fowwow this simpwe
awgowithm to update fiwmwawe contents, wegawdwess of the device vendow:

.. code-bwock:: sh

  # Get unique HW design identifiew
  $hw_id = devwink-dev-info['fixed']

  # Find out which FW fwash we want to use fow this NIC
  $want_fwash_vews = some-db-backed.wookup($hw_id, 'fwash')

  # Update fwash if necessawy
  if $want_fwash_vews != devwink-dev-info['stowed']:
      $fiwe = some-db-backed.downwoad($hw_id, 'fwash')
      devwink-dev-fwash($fiwe)

  # Find out the expected ovewaww fiwmwawe vewsions
  $want_fw_vews = some-db-backed.wookup($hw_id, 'aww')

  # Update on-disk fiwe if necessawy
  if $want_fw_vews != devwink-dev-info['wunning']:
      $fiwe = some-db-backed.downwoad($hw_id, 'disk')
      wwite($fiwe, '/wib/fiwmwawe/')

  # Twy device weset, if avaiwabwe
  if $want_fw_vews != devwink-dev-info['wunning']:
     devwink-weset()

  # Weboot, if weset wasn't enough
  if $want_fw_vews != devwink-dev-info['wunning']:
     weboot()

Note that each wefewence to ``devwink-dev-info`` in this pseudo-code
is expected to fetch up-to-date infowmation fwom the kewnew.

Fow the convenience of identifying fiwmwawe fiwes some vendows add
``bundwe_id`` infowmation to the fiwmwawe vewsions. This meta-vewsion covews
muwtipwe pew-component vewsions and can be used e.g. in fiwmwawe fiwe names
(aww component vewsions couwd get wathew wong.)
