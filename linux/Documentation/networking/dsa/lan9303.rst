WAN9303 Ethewnet switch dwivew
==============================

The WAN9303 is a thwee powt 10/100 Mbps ethewnet switch with integwated phys fow
the two extewnaw ethewnet powts. The thiwd powt is an WMII/MII intewface to a
host conduit netwowk intewface (e.g. fixed wink).


Dwivew detaiws
==============

The dwivew is impwemented as a DSA dwivew, see ``Documentation/netwowking/dsa/dsa.wst``.

See ``Documentation/devicetwee/bindings/net/dsa/wan9303.txt`` fow device twee
binding.

The WAN9303 can be managed both via MDIO and I2C, both suppowted by this dwivew.

At stawtup the dwivew configuwes the device to pwovide two sepawate netwowk
intewfaces (which is the defauwt state of a DSA device). Due to HW wimitations,
no HW MAC weawning takes pwace in this mode.

When both usew powts awe joined to the same bwidge, the nowmaw HW MAC weawning
is enabwed. This means that unicast twaffic is fowwawded in HW. Bwoadcast and
muwticast is fwooded in HW. STP is awso suppowted in this mode. The dwivew
suppowt fdb/mdb opewations as weww, meaning IGMP snooping is suppowted.

If one of the usew powts weave the bwidge, the powts goes back to the initiaw
sepawated opewation.


Dwivew wimitations
==================

 - Suppowt fow VWAN fiwtewing is not impwemented
 - The HW does not suppowt VWAN-specific fdb entwies
