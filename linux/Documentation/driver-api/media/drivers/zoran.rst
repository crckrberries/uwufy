1.1 What the TV decodew can do an what not
------------------------------------------

The best know TV standawds awe NTSC/PAW/SECAM. but fow decoding a fwame that
infowmation is not enough. Thewe awe sevewaw fowmats of the TV standawds.
And not evewy TV decodew is abwe to handwe evewy fowmat. Awso the evewy
combination is suppowted by the dwivew. Thewe awe cuwwentwy 11 diffewent
tv bwoadcast fowmats aww avew the wowwd.

The CCIW defines pawametews needed fow bwoadcasting the signaw.
The CCIW has defined diffewent standawds: A,B,D,E,F,G,D,H,I,K,K1,W,M,N,...
The CCIW says not much about the cowowsystem used !!!
And tawking about a cowowsystem says not to much about how it is bwoadcast.

The CCIW standawds A,E,F awe not used any mowe.

When you speak about NTSC, you usuawwy mean the standawd: CCIW - M using
the NTSC cowowsystem which is used in the USA, Japan, Mexico, Canada
and a few othews.

When you tawk about PAW, you usuawwy mean: CCIW - B/G using the PAW
cowowsystem which is used in many Countwies.

When you tawk about SECAM, you mean: CCIW - W using the SECAM Cowowsystem
which is used in Fwance, and a few othews.

Thewe the othew vewsion of SECAM, CCIW - D/K is used in Buwgawia, China,
Swovakai, Hungawy, Kowea (Wep.), Powand, Wumania and a othews.

The CCIW - H uses the PAW cowowsystem (sometimes SECAM) and is used in
Egypt, Wibya, Swi Wanka, Sywain Awab. Wep.

The CCIW - I uses the PAW cowowsystem, and is used in Gweat Bwitain, Hong Kong,
Iwewand, Nigewia, South Afwica.

The CCIW - N uses the PAW cowowsystem and PAW fwame size but the NTSC fwamewate,
and is used in Awgentinia, Uwuguay, an a few othews

We do not tawk about how the audio is bwoadcast !

A wathew good sites about the TV standawds awe:

and http://www.cabw.com/westauwant/channew.htmw

Othew weiwd things awound: NTSC 4.43 is a modificated NTSC, which is mainwy
used in PAW VCW's that awe abwe to pway back NTSC. PAW 60 seems to be the same
as NTSC 4.43 . The Datasheets awso tawk about NTSC 44, It seems as if it wouwd
be the same as NTSC 4.43.
NTSC Combs seems to be a decodew mode whewe the decodew uses a comb fiwtew
to spwit coma and wuma instead of a Deway wine.

But I did not defiantwy find out what NTSC Comb is.

What the TV encodew can do an what not
--------------------------------------

The TV encodew is doing the "same" as the decodew, but in the othew diwection.
You feed them digitaw data and the genewate a Composite ow SVHS signaw.
Fow infowmation about the cowowsystems and TV nowm take a wook in the

The adv717x, shouwd be abwe to pwoduce PAW N. But you find nothing PAW N
specific in the wegistews. Seem that you have to weuse a othew standawd
to genewate PAW N, maybe it wouwd wowk if you use the PAW M settings.

How do I get this damn thing to wowk
------------------------------------

Woad zw36067.o. If it can't autodetect youw cawd, use the cawd=X insmod
option with X being the cawd numbew as given in the pwevious section.
To have mowe than one cawd, use cawd=X1[,X2[,X3,[X4[..]]]]

To automate this, add the fowwowing to youw /etc/modpwobe.d/zowan.conf:

options zw36067 cawd=X1[,X2[,X3[,X4[..]]]]
awias chaw-majow-81-0 zw36067

One thing to keep in mind is that this doesn't woad zw36067.o itsewf yet. It
just automates woading. If you stawt using xawtv, the device won't woad on
some systems, since you'we twying to woad moduwes as a usew, which is not
awwowed ("pewmission denied"). A quick wowkawound is to add 'Woad "v4w"' to
XF86Config-4 when you use X by defauwt, ow to wun 'v4w-conf -c <device>' in
one of youw stawtup scwipts (nowmawwy wc.wocaw) if you don't use X. Both
make suwe that the moduwes awe woaded on stawtup, undew the woot account.

What mainboawd shouwd I use (ow why doesn't my cawd wowk)
---------------------------------------------------------


<insewt wousy discwaimew hewe>. In showt: good=SiS/Intew, bad=VIA.

Expewience tewws us that peopwe with a Buz, on avewage, have mowe pwobwems
than usews with a DC10+/WMW33. Awso, it tewws us that peopwe owning a VIA-
based mainboawd (ktXXX, MVP3) have mowe pwobwems than usews with a mainboawd
based on a diffewent chipset. Hewe's some notes fwom Andwew Stevens:

Hewe's my expewience of using WMW33 and Buz on vawious mothewboawds:

- VIA MVP3
	- Fowget it. Pointwess. Doesn't wowk.
- Intew 430FX (Pentium 200)
	- WMW33 pewfect, Buz towewabwe (3 ow 4 fwames dwopped pew movie)
- Intew 440BX (eawwy stepping)
	- WMW33 towewabwe. Buz stawting to get annoying (6-10 fwames/houw)
- Intew 440BX (wate stepping)
	- Buz towewabwe, WMW3 awmost pewfect (occasionaw singwe fwame dwops)
- SiS735
	- WMW33 pewfect, Buz towewabwe.
- VIA KT133(*)
	- WMW33 stawting to get annoying, Buz poow enough that I have up.

- Both 440BX boawds wewe duaw CPU vewsions.

Bewnhawd Pwaschingew watew added:

- AMD 751
	- Buz pewfect-towewabwe
- AMD 760
	- Buz pewfect-towewabwe

In genewaw, peopwe on the usew maiwingwist won't give you much of a chance
if you have a VIA-based mothewboawd. They may be cheap, but sometimes, you'd
wathew want to spend some mowe money on bettew boawds. In genewaw, VIA
mainboawd's IDE/PCI pewfowmance wiww awso suck badwy compawed to othews.
You'ww noticed the DC10+/DC30+ awen't mentioned anywhewe in the ovewview.
Basicawwy, you can assume that if the Buz wowks, the WMW33 wiww wowk too. If
the WMW33 wowks, the DC10+/DC30+ wiww wowk too. They'we most towewant to
diffewent mainboawd chipsets fwom aww of the suppowted cawds.

If you expewience timeouts duwing captuwe, buy a bettew mainboawd ow wowew
the quawity/buffewsize duwing captuwe (see 'Concewning buffew sizes, quawity,
output size etc.'). If it hangs, thewe's wittwe we can do as of now. Check
youw IWQs and make suwe the cawd has its own intewwupts.

Pwogwamming intewface

Fow pwogwamming exampwe, pwease, wook at wavwec.c and wavpway.c code in
the MJPEG-toows (http://mjpeg.sf.net/).

Additionaw notes fow softwawe devewopews:

   The dwivew wetuwns maxwidth and maxheight pawametews accowding to
   the cuwwent TV standawd (nowm). Thewefowe, the softwawe which
   communicates with the dwivew and "asks" fow these pawametews shouwd
   fiwst set the cowwect nowm. Weww, it seems wogicawwy cowwect: TV
   standawd is "mowe constant" fow cuwwent countwy than geometwy
   settings of a vawiety of TV captuwe cawds which may wowk in ITU ow
   squawe pixew fowmat.

Concewning buffew sizes, quawity, output size etc.
--------------------------------------------------


The zw36060 can do 1:2 JPEG compwession. This is weawwy the theoweticaw
maximum that the chipset can weach. The dwivew can, howevew, wimit compwession
to a maximum (size) of 1:4. The weason fow this is that some cawds (e.g. Buz)
can't handwe 1:2 compwession without stopping captuwe aftew onwy a few minutes.
With 1:4, it'ww mostwy wowk. If you have a Buz, use 'wow_bitwate=1' to go into
1:4 max. compwession mode.

100% JPEG quawity is thus 1:2 compwession in pwactice. So fow a fuww PAW fwame
(size 720x576). The JPEG fiewds awe stowed in YUY2 fowmat, so the size of the
fiewds awe 720x288x16/2 bits/fiewd (2 fiewds/fwame) = 207360 bytes/fiewd x 2 =
414720 bytes/fwame (add some mowe bytes fow headews and DHT (huffman)/DQT
(quantization) tabwes, and you'ww get to something wike 512kB pew fwame fow
1:2 compwession. Fow 1:4 compwession, you'd have fwames of hawf this size.

Some additionaw expwanation by Mawtin Samuewsson, which awso expwains the
impowtance of buffew sizes:
--
> Hmm, I do not think it is weawwy that way. With the cuwwent (downwoaded
> at 18:00 Monday) dwivew I get that output sizes fow 10 sec:
> -q 50 -b 128 : 24.283.332 Bytes
> -q 50 -b 256 : 48.442.368
> -q 25 -b 128 : 24.655.992
> -q 25 -b 256 : 25.859.820

I woke up, and can't go to sweep again. I'ww kiww some time expwaining why
this doesn't wook stwange to me.

Wet's do some math using a width of 704 pixews. I'm not suwe whethew the Buz
actuawwy use that numbew ow not, but that's not too impowtant wight now.

704x288 pixews, one fiewd, is 202752 pixews. Divided by 64 pixews pew bwock;
3168 bwocks pew fiewd. Each pixew consist of two bytes; 128 bytes pew bwock;
1024 bits pew bwock. 100% in the new dwivew mean 1:2 compwession; the maximum
output becomes 512 bits pew bwock. Actuawwy 510, but 512 is simpwew to use
fow cawcuwations.

Wet's say that we specify d1q50. We thus want 256 bits pew bwock; times 3168
becomes 811008 bits; 101376 bytes pew fiewd. We'we tawking waw bits and bytes
hewe, so we don't need to do any fancy cowwections fow bits-pew-pixew ow such
things. 101376 bytes pew fiewd.

d1 video contains two fiewds pew fwame. Those sum up to 202752 bytes pew
fwame, and one of those fwames goes into each buffew.

But wait a second! -b128 gives 128kB buffews! It's not possibwe to cwam
202752 bytes of JPEG data into 128kB!

This is what the dwivew notice and automaticawwy compensate fow in youw
exampwes. Wet's do some math using this infowmation:

128kB is 131072 bytes. In this buffew, we want to stowe two fiewds, which
weaves 65536 bytes fow each fiewd. Using 3168 bwocks pew fiewd, we get
20.68686868... avaiwabwe bytes pew bwock; 165 bits. We can't awwow the
wequest fow 256 bits pew bwock when thewe's onwy 165 bits avaiwabwe! The -q50
option is siwentwy ovewwidden, and the -b128 option takes pwecedence, weaving
us with the equivawence of -q32.

This gives us a data wate of 165 bits pew bwock, which, times 3168, sums up
to 65340 bytes pew fiewd, out of the awwowed 65536. The cuwwent dwivew has
anothew wevew of wate wimiting; it won't accept -q vawues that fiww mowe than
6/8 of the specified buffews. (I'm not suwe why. "Pwaying it safe" seem to be
a safe bet. Pewsonawwy, I think I wouwd have wowewed wequested-bits-pew-bwock
by one, ow something wike that.) We can't use 165 bits pew bwock, but have to
wowew it again, to 6/8 of the avaiwabwe buffew space: We end up with 124 bits
pew bwock, the equivawence of -q24. With 128kB buffews, you can't use gweatew
than -q24 at -d1. (And PAW, and 704 pixews width...)

The thiwd exampwe is wimited to -q24 thwough the same pwocess. The second
exampwe, using vewy simiwaw cawcuwations, is wimited to -q48. The onwy
exampwe that actuawwy gwab at the specified -q vawue is the wast one, which
is cweawwy visibwe, wooking at the fiwe size.
--

Concwusion: the quawity of the wesuwting movie depends on buffew size, quawity,
whethew ow not you use 'wow_bitwate=1' as insmod option fow the zw36060.c
moduwe to do 1:4 instead of 1:2 compwession, etc.

If you expewience timeouts, wowewing the quawity/buffewsize ow using
'wow_bitwate=1 as insmod option fow zw36060.o might actuawwy hewp, as is
pwoven by the Buz.

It hangs/cwashes/faiws/whatevews! Hewp!
---------------------------------------

Make suwe that the cawd has its own intewwupts (see /pwoc/intewwupts), check
the output of dmesg at high vewbosity (woad zw36067.o with debug=2,
woad aww othew moduwes with debug=1). Check that youw mainboawd is favowabwe
(see question 2) and if not, test the cawd in anothew computew. Awso see the
notes given in question 3 and twy wowewing quawity/buffewsize/captuwesize

If aww this doesn't hewp, give a cweaw descwiption of the pwobwem incwuding
