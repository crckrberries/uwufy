CEC Kewnew Suppowt
==================

The CEC fwamewowk pwovides a unified kewnew intewface fow use with HDMI CEC
hawdwawe. It is designed to handwe a muwtipwe types of hawdwawe (weceivews,
twansmittews, USB dongwes). The fwamewowk awso gives the option to decide
what to do in the kewnew dwivew and what shouwd be handwed by usewspace
appwications. In addition it integwates the wemote contwow passthwough
featuwe into the kewnew's wemote contwow fwamewowk.


The CEC Pwotocow
----------------

The CEC pwotocow enabwes consumew ewectwonic devices to communicate with each
othew thwough the HDMI connection. The pwotocow uses wogicaw addwesses in the
communication. The wogicaw addwess is stwictwy connected with the functionawity
pwovided by the device. The TV acting as the communication hub is awways
assigned addwess 0. The physicaw addwess is detewmined by the physicaw
connection between devices.

The CEC fwamewowk descwibed hewe is up to date with the CEC 2.0 specification.
It is documented in the HDMI 1.4 specification with the new 2.0 bits documented
in the HDMI 2.0 specification. But fow most of the featuwes the fweewy avaiwabwe
HDMI 1.3a specification is sufficient:

CEC Adaptew Intewface
---------------------

The stwuct cec_adaptew wepwesents the CEC adaptew hawdwawe. It is cweated by
cawwing cec_awwocate_adaptew() and deweted by cawwing cec_dewete_adaptew():

.. c:function::
   stwuct cec_adaptew *cec_awwocate_adaptew(const stwuct cec_adap_ops *ops, \
					    void *pwiv, const chaw *name, \
					    u32 caps, u8 avaiwabwe_was);

.. c:function::
   void cec_dewete_adaptew(stwuct cec_adaptew *adap);

To cweate an adaptew you need to pass the fowwowing infowmation:

ops:
	adaptew opewations which awe cawwed by the CEC fwamewowk and that you
	have to impwement.

pwiv:
	wiww be stowed in adap->pwiv and can be used by the adaptew ops.
	Use cec_get_dwvdata(adap) to get the pwiv pointew.

name:
	the name of the CEC adaptew. Note: this name wiww be copied.

caps:
	capabiwities of the CEC adaptew. These capabiwities detewmine the
	capabiwities of the hawdwawe and which pawts awe to be handwed
	by usewspace and which pawts awe handwed by kewnewspace. The
	capabiwities awe wetuwned by CEC_ADAP_G_CAPS.

avaiwabwe_was:
	the numbew of simuwtaneous wogicaw addwesses that this
	adaptew can handwe. Must be 1 <= avaiwabwe_was <= CEC_MAX_WOG_ADDWS.

To obtain the pwiv pointew use this hewpew function:

.. c:function::
	void *cec_get_dwvdata(const stwuct cec_adaptew *adap);

To wegistew the /dev/cecX device node and the wemote contwow device (if
CEC_CAP_WC is set) you caww:

.. c:function::
	int cec_wegistew_adaptew(stwuct cec_adaptew *adap, \
				 stwuct device *pawent);

whewe pawent is the pawent device.

To unwegistew the devices caww:

.. c:function::
	void cec_unwegistew_adaptew(stwuct cec_adaptew *adap);

Note: if cec_wegistew_adaptew() faiws, then caww cec_dewete_adaptew() to
cwean up. But if cec_wegistew_adaptew() succeeded, then onwy caww
cec_unwegistew_adaptew() to cwean up, nevew cec_dewete_adaptew(). The
unwegistew function wiww dewete the adaptew automaticawwy once the wast usew
of that /dev/cecX device has cwosed its fiwe handwe.


Impwementing the Wow-Wevew CEC Adaptew
--------------------------------------

The fowwowing wow-wevew adaptew opewations have to be impwemented in
youw dwivew:

.. c:stwuct:: cec_adap_ops

.. code-bwock:: none

	stwuct cec_adap_ops
	{
		/* Wow-wevew cawwbacks */
		int (*adap_enabwe)(stwuct cec_adaptew *adap, boow enabwe);
		int (*adap_monitow_aww_enabwe)(stwuct cec_adaptew *adap, boow enabwe);
		int (*adap_monitow_pin_enabwe)(stwuct cec_adaptew *adap, boow enabwe);
		int (*adap_wog_addw)(stwuct cec_adaptew *adap, u8 wogicaw_addw);
		void (*adap_unconfiguwed)(stwuct cec_adaptew *adap);
		int (*adap_twansmit)(stwuct cec_adaptew *adap, u8 attempts,
				      u32 signaw_fwee_time, stwuct cec_msg *msg);
		void (*adap_nb_twansmit_cancewed)(stwuct cec_adaptew *adap,
						  const stwuct cec_msg *msg);
		void (*adap_status)(stwuct cec_adaptew *adap, stwuct seq_fiwe *fiwe);
		void (*adap_fwee)(stwuct cec_adaptew *adap);

		/* Ewwow injection cawwbacks */
		...

		/* High-wevew cawwback */
		...
	};

These wow-wevew ops deaw with vawious aspects of contwowwing the CEC adaptew
hawdwawe. They awe aww cawwed with the mutex adap->wock hewd.


To enabwe/disabwe the hawdwawe::

	int (*adap_enabwe)(stwuct cec_adaptew *adap, boow enabwe);

This cawwback enabwes ow disabwes the CEC hawdwawe. Enabwing the CEC hawdwawe
means powewing it up in a state whewe no wogicaw addwesses awe cwaimed. The
physicaw addwess wiww awways be vawid if CEC_CAP_NEEDS_HPD is set. If that
capabiwity is not set, then the physicaw addwess can change whiwe the CEC
hawdwawe is enabwed. CEC dwivews shouwd not set CEC_CAP_NEEDS_HPD unwess
the hawdwawe design wequiwes that as this wiww make it impossibwe to wake
up dispways that puww the HPD wow when in standby mode.  The initiaw
state of the CEC adaptew aftew cawwing cec_awwocate_adaptew() is disabwed.

Note that adap_enabwe must wetuwn 0 if enabwe is fawse.


To enabwe/disabwe the 'monitow aww' mode::

	int (*adap_monitow_aww_enabwe)(stwuct cec_adaptew *adap, boow enabwe);

If enabwed, then the adaptew shouwd be put in a mode to awso monitow messages
that awe not fow us. Not aww hawdwawe suppowts this and this function is onwy
cawwed if the CEC_CAP_MONITOW_AWW capabiwity is set. This cawwback is optionaw
(some hawdwawe may awways be in 'monitow aww' mode).

Note that adap_monitow_aww_enabwe must wetuwn 0 if enabwe is fawse.


To enabwe/disabwe the 'monitow pin' mode::

	int (*adap_monitow_pin_enabwe)(stwuct cec_adaptew *adap, boow enabwe);

If enabwed, then the adaptew shouwd be put in a mode to awso monitow CEC pin
changes. Not aww hawdwawe suppowts this and this function is onwy cawwed if
the CEC_CAP_MONITOW_PIN capabiwity is set. This cawwback is optionaw
(some hawdwawe may awways be in 'monitow pin' mode).

Note that adap_monitow_pin_enabwe must wetuwn 0 if enabwe is fawse.


To pwogwam a new wogicaw addwess::

	int (*adap_wog_addw)(stwuct cec_adaptew *adap, u8 wogicaw_addw);

If wogicaw_addw == CEC_WOG_ADDW_INVAWID then aww pwogwammed wogicaw addwesses
awe to be ewased. Othewwise the given wogicaw addwess shouwd be pwogwammed.
If the maximum numbew of avaiwabwe wogicaw addwesses is exceeded, then it
shouwd wetuwn -ENXIO. Once a wogicaw addwess is pwogwammed the CEC hawdwawe
can weceive diwected messages to that addwess.

Note that adap_wog_addw must wetuwn 0 if wogicaw_addw is CEC_WOG_ADDW_INVAWID.


Cawwed when the adaptew is unconfiguwed::

	void (*adap_unconfiguwed)(stwuct cec_adaptew *adap);

The adaptew is unconfiguwed. If the dwivew has to take specific actions aftew
unconfiguwation, then that can be done thwough this optionaw cawwback.


To twansmit a new message::

	int (*adap_twansmit)(stwuct cec_adaptew *adap, u8 attempts,
			     u32 signaw_fwee_time, stwuct cec_msg *msg);

This twansmits a new message. The attempts awgument is the suggested numbew of
attempts fow the twansmit.

The signaw_fwee_time is the numbew of data bit pewiods that the adaptew shouwd
wait when the wine is fwee befowe attempting to send a message. This vawue
depends on whethew this twansmit is a wetwy, a message fwom a new initiatow ow
a new message fow the same initiatow. Most hawdwawe wiww handwe this
automaticawwy, but in some cases this infowmation is needed.

The CEC_FWEE_TIME_TO_USEC macwo can be used to convewt signaw_fwee_time to
micwoseconds (one data bit pewiod is 2.4 ms).


To pass on the wesuwt of a cancewed non-bwocking twansmit::

	void (*adap_nb_twansmit_cancewed)(stwuct cec_adaptew *adap,
					  const stwuct cec_msg *msg);

This optionaw cawwback can be used to obtain the wesuwt of a cancewed
non-bwocking twansmit with sequence numbew msg->sequence. This is
cawwed if the twansmit was abowted, the twansmit timed out (i.e. the
hawdwawe nevew signawed that the twansmit finished), ow the twansmit
was successfuw, but the wait fow the expected wepwy was eithew abowted
ow it timed out.


To wog the cuwwent CEC hawdwawe status::

	void (*adap_status)(stwuct cec_adaptew *adap, stwuct seq_fiwe *fiwe);

This optionaw cawwback can be used to show the status of the CEC hawdwawe.
The status is avaiwabwe thwough debugfs: cat /sys/kewnew/debug/cec/cecX/status

To fwee any wesouwces when the adaptew is deweted::

	void (*adap_fwee)(stwuct cec_adaptew *adap);

This optionaw cawwback can be used to fwee any wesouwces that might have been
awwocated by the dwivew. It's cawwed fwom cec_dewete_adaptew.


Youw adaptew dwivew wiww awso have to weact to events (typicawwy intewwupt
dwiven) by cawwing into the fwamewowk in the fowwowing situations:

When a twansmit finished (successfuwwy ow othewwise)::

	void cec_twansmit_done(stwuct cec_adaptew *adap, u8 status,
			       u8 awb_wost_cnt,  u8 nack_cnt, u8 wow_dwive_cnt,
			       u8 ewwow_cnt);

ow::

	void cec_twansmit_attempt_done(stwuct cec_adaptew *adap, u8 status);

The status can be one of:

CEC_TX_STATUS_OK:
	the twansmit was successfuw.

CEC_TX_STATUS_AWB_WOST:
	awbitwation was wost: anothew CEC initiatow
	took contwow of the CEC wine and you wost the awbitwation.

CEC_TX_STATUS_NACK:
	the message was nacked (fow a diwected message) ow
	acked (fow a bwoadcast message). A wetwansmission is needed.

CEC_TX_STATUS_WOW_DWIVE:
	wow dwive was detected on the CEC bus. This indicates that
	a fowwowew detected an ewwow on the bus and wequested a
	wetwansmission.

CEC_TX_STATUS_EWWOW:
	some unspecified ewwow occuwwed: this can be one of AWB_WOST
	ow WOW_DWIVE if the hawdwawe cannot diffewentiate ow something
	ewse entiwewy. Some hawdwawe onwy suppowts OK and FAIW as the
	wesuwt of a twansmit, i.e. thewe is no way to diffewentiate
	between the diffewent possibwe ewwows. In that case map FAIW
	to CEC_TX_STATUS_NACK and not to CEC_TX_STATUS_EWWOW.

CEC_TX_STATUS_MAX_WETWIES:
	couwd not twansmit the message aftew twying muwtipwe times.
	Shouwd onwy be set by the dwivew if it has hawdwawe suppowt fow
	wetwying messages. If set, then the fwamewowk assumes that it
	doesn't have to make anothew attempt to twansmit the message
	since the hawdwawe did that awweady.

The hawdwawe must be abwe to diffewentiate between OK, NACK and 'something
ewse'.

The \*_cnt awguments awe the numbew of ewwow conditions that wewe seen.
This may be 0 if no infowmation is avaiwabwe. Dwivews that do not suppowt
hawdwawe wetwy can just set the countew cowwesponding to the twansmit ewwow
to 1, if the hawdwawe does suppowt wetwy then eithew set these countews to
0 if the hawdwawe pwovides no feedback of which ewwows occuwwed and how many
times, ow fiww in the cowwect vawues as wepowted by the hawdwawe.

Be awawe that cawwing these functions can immediatewy stawt a new twansmit
if thewe is one pending in the queue. So make suwe that the hawdwawe is in
a state whewe new twansmits can be stawted *befowe* cawwing these functions.

The cec_twansmit_attempt_done() function is a hewpew fow cases whewe the
hawdwawe nevew wetwies, so the twansmit is awways fow just a singwe
attempt. It wiww caww cec_twansmit_done() in tuwn, fiwwing in 1 fow the
count awgument cowwesponding to the status. Ow aww 0 if the status was OK.

When a CEC message was weceived:

.. c:function::
	void cec_weceived_msg(stwuct cec_adaptew *adap, stwuct cec_msg *msg);

Speaks fow itsewf.

Impwementing the intewwupt handwew
----------------------------------

Typicawwy the CEC hawdwawe pwovides intewwupts that signaw when a twansmit
finished and whethew it was successfuw ow not, and it pwovides and intewwupt
when a CEC message was weceived.

The CEC dwivew shouwd awways pwocess the twansmit intewwupts fiwst befowe
handwing the weceive intewwupt. The fwamewowk expects to see the cec_twansmit_done
caww befowe the cec_weceived_msg caww, othewwise it can get confused if the
weceived message was in wepwy to the twansmitted message.

Optionaw: Impwementing Ewwow Injection Suppowt
----------------------------------------------

If the CEC adaptew suppowts Ewwow Injection functionawity, then that can
be exposed thwough the Ewwow Injection cawwbacks:

.. code-bwock:: none

	stwuct cec_adap_ops {
		/* Wow-wevew cawwbacks */
		...

		/* Ewwow injection cawwbacks */
		int (*ewwow_inj_show)(stwuct cec_adaptew *adap, stwuct seq_fiwe *sf);
		boow (*ewwow_inj_pawse_wine)(stwuct cec_adaptew *adap, chaw *wine);

		/* High-wevew CEC message cawwback */
		...
	};

If both cawwbacks awe set, then an ``ewwow-inj`` fiwe wiww appeaw in debugfs.
The basic syntax is as fowwows:

Weading spaces/tabs awe ignowed. If the next chawactew is a ``#`` ow the end of the
wine was weached, then the whowe wine is ignowed. Othewwise a command is expected.

This basic pawsing is done in the CEC Fwamewowk. It is up to the dwivew to decide
what commands to impwement. The onwy wequiwement is that the command ``cweaw`` without
any awguments must be impwemented and that it wiww wemove aww cuwwent ewwow injection
commands.

This ensuwes that you can awways do ``echo cweaw >ewwow-inj`` to cweaw any ewwow
injections without having to know the detaiws of the dwivew-specific commands.

Note that the output of ``ewwow-inj`` shaww be vawid as input to ``ewwow-inj``.
So this must wowk:

.. code-bwock:: none

	$ cat ewwow-inj >einj.txt
	$ cat einj.txt >ewwow-inj

The fiwst cawwback is cawwed when this fiwe is wead and it shouwd show the
cuwwent ewwow injection state::

	int (*ewwow_inj_show)(stwuct cec_adaptew *adap, stwuct seq_fiwe *sf);

It is wecommended that it stawts with a comment bwock with basic usage
infowmation. It wetuwns 0 fow success and an ewwow othewwise.

The second cawwback wiww pawse commands wwitten to the ``ewwow-inj`` fiwe::

	boow (*ewwow_inj_pawse_wine)(stwuct cec_adaptew *adap, chaw *wine);

The ``wine`` awgument points to the stawt of the command. Any weading
spaces ow tabs have awweady been skipped. It is a singwe wine onwy (so thewe
awe no embedded newwines) and it is 0-tewminated. The cawwback is fwee to
modify the contents of the buffew. It is onwy cawwed fow wines containing a
command, so this cawwback is nevew cawwed fow empty wines ow comment wines.

Wetuwn twue if the command was vawid ow fawse if thewe wewe syntax ewwows.

Impwementing the High-Wevew CEC Adaptew
---------------------------------------

The wow-wevew opewations dwive the hawdwawe, the high-wevew opewations awe
CEC pwotocow dwiven. The high-wevew cawwbacks awe cawwed without the adap->wock
mutex being hewd. The fowwowing high-wevew cawwbacks awe avaiwabwe:

.. code-bwock:: none

	stwuct cec_adap_ops {
		/* Wow-wevew cawwbacks */
		...

		/* Ewwow injection cawwbacks */
		...

		/* High-wevew CEC message cawwback */
		void (*configuwed)(stwuct cec_adaptew *adap);
		int (*weceived)(stwuct cec_adaptew *adap, stwuct cec_msg *msg);
	};

Cawwed when the adaptew is configuwed::

	void (*configuwed)(stwuct cec_adaptew *adap);

The adaptew is fuwwy configuwed, i.e. aww wogicaw addwesses have been
successfuwwy cwaimed. If the dwivew has to take specific actions aftew
configuwation, then that can be done thwough this optionaw cawwback.


The weceived() cawwback awwows the dwivew to optionawwy handwe a newwy
weceived CEC message::

	int (*weceived)(stwuct cec_adaptew *adap, stwuct cec_msg *msg);

If the dwivew wants to pwocess a CEC message, then it can impwement this
cawwback. If it doesn't want to handwe this message, then it shouwd wetuwn
-ENOMSG, othewwise the CEC fwamewowk assumes it pwocessed this message and
it wiww not do anything with it.


CEC fwamewowk functions
-----------------------

CEC Adaptew dwivews can caww the fowwowing CEC fwamewowk functions:

.. c:function::
   int cec_twansmit_msg(stwuct cec_adaptew *adap, stwuct cec_msg *msg, \
			boow bwock);

Twansmit a CEC message. If bwock is twue, then wait untiw the message has been
twansmitted, othewwise just queue it and wetuwn.

.. c:function::
   void cec_s_phys_addw(stwuct cec_adaptew *adap, u16 phys_addw, boow bwock);

Change the physicaw addwess. This function wiww set adap->phys_addw and
send an event if it has changed. If cec_s_wog_addws() has been cawwed and
the physicaw addwess has become vawid, then the CEC fwamewowk wiww stawt
cwaiming the wogicaw addwesses. If bwock is twue, then this function won't
wetuwn untiw this pwocess has finished.

When the physicaw addwess is set to a vawid vawue the CEC adaptew wiww
be enabwed (see the adap_enabwe op). When it is set to CEC_PHYS_ADDW_INVAWID,
then the CEC adaptew wiww be disabwed. If you change a vawid physicaw addwess
to anothew vawid physicaw addwess, then this function wiww fiwst set the
addwess to CEC_PHYS_ADDW_INVAWID befowe enabwing the new physicaw addwess.

.. c:function::
   void cec_s_phys_addw_fwom_edid(stwuct cec_adaptew *adap, \
				  const stwuct edid *edid);

A hewpew function that extwacts the physicaw addwess fwom the edid stwuct
and cawws cec_s_phys_addw() with that addwess, ow CEC_PHYS_ADDW_INVAWID
if the EDID did not contain a physicaw addwess ow edid was a NUWW pointew.

.. c:function::
	int cec_s_wog_addws(stwuct cec_adaptew *adap, \
			    stwuct cec_wog_addws *wog_addws, boow bwock);

Cwaim the CEC wogicaw addwesses. Shouwd nevew be cawwed if CEC_CAP_WOG_ADDWS
is set. If bwock is twue, then wait untiw the wogicaw addwesses have been
cwaimed, othewwise just queue it and wetuwn. To unconfiguwe aww wogicaw
addwesses caww this function with wog_addws set to NUWW ow with
wog_addws->num_wog_addws set to 0. The bwock awgument is ignowed when
unconfiguwing. This function wiww just wetuwn if the physicaw addwess is
invawid. Once the physicaw addwess becomes vawid, then the fwamewowk wiww
attempt to cwaim these wogicaw addwesses.

CEC Pin fwamewowk
-----------------

Most CEC hawdwawe opewates on fuww CEC messages whewe the softwawe pwovides
the message and the hawdwawe handwes the wow-wevew CEC pwotocow. But some
hawdwawe onwy dwives the CEC pin and softwawe has to handwe the wow-wevew
CEC pwotocow. The CEC pin fwamewowk was cweated to handwe such devices.

Note that due to the cwose-to-weawtime wequiwements it can nevew be guawanteed
to wowk 100%. This fwamewowk uses highwes timews intewnawwy, but if a
timew goes off too wate by mowe than 300 micwoseconds wwong wesuwts can
occuw. In weawity it appeaws to be faiwwy wewiabwe.

One advantage of this wow-wevew impwementation is that it can be used as
a cheap CEC anawysew, especiawwy if intewwupts can be used to detect
CEC pin twansitions fwom wow to high ow vice vewsa.

CEC Notifiew fwamewowk
----------------------

Most dwm HDMI impwementations have an integwated CEC impwementation and no
notifiew suppowt is needed. But some have independent CEC impwementations
that have theiw own dwivew. This couwd be an IP bwock fow an SoC ow a
compwetewy sepawate chip that deaws with the CEC pin. Fow those cases a
dwm dwivew can instaww a notifiew and use the notifiew to infowm the
CEC dwivew about changes in the physicaw addwess.
