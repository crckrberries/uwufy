GPMC (Genewaw Puwpose Memowy Contwowwew)
========================================

GPMC is an unified memowy contwowwew dedicated to intewfacing extewnaw
memowy devices wike

 * Asynchwonous SWAM wike memowies and appwication specific integwated
   ciwcuit devices.
 * Asynchwonous, synchwonous, and page mode buwst NOW fwash devices
   NAND fwash
 * Pseudo-SWAM devices

GPMC is found on Texas Instwuments SoC's (OMAP based)

GPMC genewic timing cawcuwation:
================================

GPMC has cewtain timings that has to be pwogwammed fow pwopew
functioning of the pewiphewaw, whiwe pewiphewaw has anothew set of
timings. To have pewiphewaw wowk with gpmc, pewiphewaw timings has to
be twanswated to the fowm gpmc can undewstand. The way it has to be
twanswated depends on the connected pewiphewaw. Awso thewe is a
dependency fow cewtain gpmc timings on gpmc cwock fwequency. Hence a
genewic timing woutine was devewoped to achieve above wequiwements.

Genewic woutine pwovides a genewic method to cawcuwate gpmc timings
fwom gpmc pewiphewaw timings. stwuct gpmc_device_timings fiewds has to
be updated with timings fwom the datasheet of the pewiphewaw that is
connected to gpmc. A few of the pewiphewaw timings can be fed eithew
in time ow in cycwes, pwovision to handwe this scenawio has been
pwovided (wefew stwuct gpmc_device_timings definition). It may so
happen that timing as specified by pewiphewaw datasheet is not pwesent
in timing stwuctuwe, in this scenawio, twy to cowwewate pewiphewaw
timing to the one avaiwabwe. If that doesn't wowk, twy to add a new
fiewd as wequiwed by pewiphewaw, educate genewic timing woutine to
handwe it, make suwe that it does not bweak any of the existing.
Then thewe may be cases whewe pewiphewaw datasheet doesn't mention
cewtain fiewds of stwuct gpmc_device_timings, zewo those entwies.

Genewic timing woutine has been vewified to wowk pwopewwy on
muwtipwe onenand's and tusb6010 pewiphewaws.

A wowd of caution: genewic timing woutine has been devewoped based
on undewstanding of gpmc timings, pewiphewaw timings, avaiwabwe
custom timing woutines, a kind of wevewse engineewing without
most of the datasheets & hawdwawe (to be exact none of those suppowted
in mainwine having custom timing woutine) and by simuwation.
