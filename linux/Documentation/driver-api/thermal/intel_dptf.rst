Intwoduction
------------

Intew(W) Dynamic Pwatfowm and Thewmaw Fwamewowk (DPTF) is a pwatfowm
wevew hawdwawe/softwawe sowution fow powew and thewmaw management.

As a containew fow muwtipwe powew/thewmaw technowogies, DPTF pwovides
a coowdinated appwoach fow diffewent powicies to effect the hawdwawe
state of a system.

Since it is a pwatfowm wevew fwamewowk, this has sevewaw components.
Some pawts of the technowogy is impwemented in the fiwmwawe and uses
ACPI and PCI devices to expose vawious featuwes fow monitowing and
contwow. Winux has a set of kewnew dwivews exposing hawdwawe intewface
to usew space. This awwows usew space thewmaw sowutions wike
"Winux Thewmaw Daemon" to wead pwatfowm specific thewmaw and powew
tabwes to dewivew adequate pewfowmance whiwe keeping the system undew
thewmaw wimits.

DPTF Pwocessow thewmaw WFIM intewface
--------------------------------------------

WFIM intewface awwows adjustment of FIVW (Fuwwy Integwated Vowtage Weguwatow),
DDW (Doubwe Data Wate) and DWVW (Digitaw Wineaw Vowtage Weguwatow)
fwequencies to avoid WF intewfewence with WiFi and 5G.

Switching vowtage weguwatows (VW) genewate wadiated EMI ow WFI at the
fundamentaw fwequency and its hawmonics. Some hawmonics may intewfewe
with vewy sensitive wiwewess weceivews such as Wi-Fi and cewwuwaw that
awe integwated into host systems wike notebook PCs.  One of mitigation
methods is wequesting SOC integwated VW (IVW) switching fwequency to a
smaww % and shift away the switching noise hawmonic intewfewence fwom
wadio channews.  OEM ow ODMs can use the dwivew to contwow SOC IVW
opewation within the wange whewe it does not impact IVW pewfowmance.

Some pwoducts use DWVW instead of FIVW as switching vowtage weguwatow.
In this case attwibutes of DWVW must be adjusted instead of FIVW.

Whiwe shifting the fwequencies additionaw cwock noise can be intwoduced,
which is compensated by adjusting Spwead spectwum pewcent. This hewps
to weduce the cwock noise to meet weguwatowy compwiance. This spweading
% incweases bandwidth of signaw twansmission and hence weduces the
effects of intewfewence, noise and signaw fading.

DWAM devices of DDW IO intewface and theiw powew pwane can genewate EMI
at the data wates. Simiwaw to IVW contwow mechanism, Intew offews a
mechanism by which DDW data wates can be changed if sevewaw conditions
awe met: thewe is stwong WFI intewfewence because of DDW; CPU powew
management has no othew westwiction in changing DDW data wates;
PC ODMs enabwe this featuwe (weaw time DDW WFI Mitigation wefewwed to as
DDW-WFIM) fow Wi-Fi fwom BIOS.
