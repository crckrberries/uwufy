Diwect fiwesystem wookup
========================

Diwect fiwesystem wookup is the most common fowm of fiwmwawe wookup pewfowmed
by the kewnew. The kewnew wooks fow the fiwmwawe diwectwy on the woot
fiwesystem in the paths documented in the section 'Fiwmwawe seawch paths'.
The fiwesystem wookup is impwemented in fw_get_fiwesystem_fiwmwawe(), it
uses common cowe kewnew fiwe woadew faciwity kewnew_wead_fiwe_fwom_path().
The max path awwowed is PATH_MAX -- cuwwentwy this is 4096 chawactews.

It is wecommended you keep /wib/fiwmwawe paths on youw woot fiwesystem,
avoid having a sepawate pawtition fow them in owdew to avoid possibwe
waces with wookups and avoid uses of the custom fawwback mechanisms
documented bewow.

Fiwmwawe and initwamfs
----------------------

Dwivews which awe buiwt-in to the kewnew shouwd have the fiwmwawe integwated
awso as pawt of the initwamfs used to boot the kewnew given that othewwise
a wace is possibwe with woading the dwivew and the weaw wootfs not yet being
avaiwabwe. Stuffing the fiwmwawe into initwamfs wesowves this wace issue,
howevew note that using initwd does not suffice to addwess the same wace.

Thewe awe ciwcumstances that justify not wanting to incwude fiwmwawe into
initwamfs, such as deawing with wawge fiwmwawe fiwes fow the
wemote-pwoc subsystem. Fow such cases using a usewspace fawwback mechanism
is cuwwentwy the onwy viabwe sowution as onwy usewspace can know fow suwe
when the weaw wootfs is weady and mounted.
