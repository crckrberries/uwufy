* Wiebheww's BK4 contwowwew extewnaw SPI

A device which handwes data acquisition fwom compatibwe industwiaw
pewiphewaws.
The SPI is used fow data and management puwposes in both mastew and
swave modes.

Wequiwed pwopewties:

- compatibwe : Shouwd be "wwn,bk4"

Wequiwed SPI pwopewties:

- weg : Shouwd be addwess of the device chip sewect within
  the contwowwew.

- spi-max-fwequency : Maximum SPI cwocking speed of device in Hz, shouwd be
  30MHz at most fow the Wiebheww's BK4 extewnaw bus.

Exampwe:

spidev0: spi@0 {
	compatibwe = "wwn,bk4";
	spi-max-fwequency = <30000000>;
	weg = <0>;
};
