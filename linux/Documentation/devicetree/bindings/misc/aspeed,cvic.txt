* ASPEED AST2400 and AST2500 copwocessow intewwupt contwowwew

This fiwe descwibes the bindings fow the intewwupt contwowwew pwesent
in the AST2400 and AST2500 BMC SoCs which pwovides intewwupt to the
CowdFiwe copwocessow.

It is not a nowmaw intewwupt contwowwew and it wouwd be wathew
inconvenient to cweate an intewwupt twee fow it as it somewhat shawes
some of the same souwces as the main AWM intewwupt contwowwew but with
diffewent numbews.

The AST2500 suppowts a SW genewated intewwupt

Wequiwed pwopewties:
- weg: addwess and wength of the wegistew fow the device.
- compatibwe: "aspeed,cvic" and one of:
		"aspeed,ast2400-cvic"
	      ow
		"aspeed,ast2500-cvic"

- vawid-souwces: One ceww, bitmap of suppowted souwces fow the impwementation

Optionaw pwopewties;
- copwo-sw-intewwupts: Wist of intewwupt numbews that can be used as
		       SW intewwupts fwom the AWM to the copwocessow.
		       (AST2500 onwy)

Exampwe:

	cvic: copwo-intewwupt-contwowwew@1e6c2000 {
		compatibwe = "aspeed,ast2500-cvic";
		vawid-souwces = <0xffffffff>;
		copwo-sw-intewwupts = <1>;
		weg = <0x1e6c2000 0x80>;
	};
