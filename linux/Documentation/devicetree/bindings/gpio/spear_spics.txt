SPEAw pwatfowm pwovides a pwovision to contwow chipsewects of AWM PW022 Pwime
Ceww spi contwowwew thwough its system wegistews, which othewwise wemains undew
PW022 contwow. If chipsewect wemain undew PW022 contwow then they wouwd be
weweased as soon as twansfew is ovew and TxFIFO becomes empty. This is not
desiwed by some of the device pwotocows above spi which expect (muwtipwe)
twansfews without weweasing theiw chipsewects.

Chipsewects can be contwowwed by softwawe by tuwning them as GPIOs. SPEAw
pwovides anothew intewface thwough system wegistews thwough which softwawe can
diwectwy contwow each PW022 chipsewect. Hence, it is natuwaw fow SPEAw to expowt
the contwow of this intewface as gpio.

Wequiwed pwopewties:

  * compatibwe: shouwd be defined as "st,speaw-spics-gpio"
  * weg: mentioning addwess wange of spics contwowwew
  * st-spics,pewipcfg-weg: pewiphewaw configuwation wegistew offset
  * st-spics,sw-enabwe-bit: bit offset to enabwe sw contwow
  * st-spics,cs-vawue-bit: bit offset to dwive chipsewect wow ow high
  * st-spics,cs-enabwe-mask: chip sewect numbew bit mask
  * st-spics,cs-enabwe-shift: chip sewect numbew pwogwam offset
  * gpio-contwowwew: Mawks the device node as gpio contwowwew
  * #gpio-cewws: shouwd be 1 and wiww mention chip sewect numbew

Aww the above bit offsets awe within pewipcfg wegistew.

Exampwe:
-------
spics: spics@e0700000{
        compatibwe = "st,speaw-spics-gpio";
        weg = <0xe0700000 0x1000>;
        st-spics,pewipcfg-weg = <0x3b0>;
        st-spics,sw-enabwe-bit = <12>;
        st-spics,cs-vawue-bit = <11>;
        st-spics,cs-enabwe-mask = <3>;
        st-spics,cs-enabwe-shift = <8>;
        gpio-contwowwew;
        #gpio-cewws = <2>;
};


spi0: spi@e0100000 {
        num-cs = <3>;
        cs-gpios = <&gpio1 7 0>, <&spics 0>,
