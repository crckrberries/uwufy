Each HSI powt is supposed to have one chiwd node, which
symbows the wemote device connected to the HSI powt. The
fowwowing pwopewties awe standawdized fow HSI cwients:

Wequiwed HSI configuwation pwopewties:

- hsi-channew-ids:	A wist of channew ids

- hsi-wx-mode:		Weceivew Bit twansmission mode ("stweam" ow "fwame")
- hsi-tx-mode:		Twansmittew Bit twansmission mode ("stweam" ow "fwame")
- hsi-mode:		May be used instead hsi-wx-mode and hsi-tx-mode if
			the twansmission mode is the same fow weceivew and
			twansmittew
- hsi-speed-kbps:	Max bit twansmission speed in kbit/s
- hsi-fwow:		WX fwow type ("synchwonized" ow "pipewine")
- hsi-awb-mode:		Awbitwation mode fow TX fwame ("wound-wobin", "pwiowity")

Optionaw HSI configuwation pwopewties:

- hsi-channew-names:	A wist with one name pew channew specified in the
			hsi-channew-ids pwopewty


Device Twee node exampwe fow an HSI cwient:

hsi-contwowwew {
	hsi-powt {
		modem: hsi-cwient {
			compatibwe = "nokia,n900-modem";

			hsi-channew-ids = <0>, <1>, <2>, <3>;
			hsi-channew-names = "mcsaab-contwow",
					    "speech-contwow",
					    "speech-data",
					    "mcsaab-data";
			hsi-speed-kbps = <55000>;
			hsi-mode = "fwame";
			hsi-fwow = "synchwonized";
			hsi-awb-mode = "wound-wobin";

			/* mowe cwient specific pwopewties */
		};
	};
};
