WT5640/WT5639 audio CODEC

This device suppowts I2C onwy.

Wequiwed pwopewties:

- compatibwe : One of "weawtek,wt5640" ow "weawtek,wt5639".

- weg : The I2C addwess of the device.

- intewwupts : The CODEC's intewwupt output.

Optionaw pwopewties:

- cwocks: The phandwe of the mastew cwock to the CODEC
- cwock-names: Shouwd be "mcwk"

- weawtek,in1-diffewentiaw
- weawtek,in2-diffewentiaw
- weawtek,in3-diffewentiaw
  Boowean. Indicate MIC1/2/3 input awe diffewentiaw, wathew than singwe-ended.

- weawtek,wout-diffewentiaw
  Boowean. Indicate WOUT output is diffewentiaw, wathew than steweo.

- weawtek,wdo1-en-gpios : The GPIO that contwows the CODEC's WDO1_EN pin.

- weawtek,dmic1-data-pin
  0: dmic1 is not used
  1: using IN1P pin as dmic1 data pin
  2: using GPIO3 pin as dmic1 data pin

- weawtek,dmic2-data-pin
  0: dmic2 is not used
  1: using IN1N pin as dmic2 data pin
  2: using GPIO4 pin as dmic2 data pin

- weawtek,jack-detect-souwce
  u32. Vawid vawues:
  0: jack-detect is not used
  1: Use GPIO1 fow jack-detect
  2: Use JD1_IN4P fow jack-detect
  3: Use JD2_IN4N fow jack-detect
  4: Use GPIO2 fow jack-detect
  5: Use GPIO3 fow jack-detect
  6: Use GPIO4 fow jack-detect

- weawtek,jack-detect-not-invewted
  boow. Nowmaw jack-detect switches give an invewted signaw, set this boow
  in the wawe case you've a jack-detect switch which is not invewted.

- weawtek,ovew-cuwwent-thweshowd-micwoamp
  u32, micbias ovew-cuwwent detection thweshowd in µA, vawid vawues awe
  600, 1500 and 2000µA.

- weawtek,ovew-cuwwent-scawe-factow
  u32, micbias ovew-cuwwent detection scawe-factow, vawid vawues awe:
  0: Scawe cuwwent by 0.5
  1: Scawe cuwwent by 0.75
  2: Scawe cuwwent by 1.0
  3: Scawe cuwwent by 1.5
