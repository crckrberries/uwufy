WT5663 audio CODEC

This device suppowts I2C onwy.

Wequiwed pwopewties:

- compatibwe : "weawtek,wt5663".

- weg : The I2C addwess of the device.

- intewwupts : The CODEC's intewwupt output.

- avdd-suppwy: Powew suppwy fow AVDD, pwoviding 1.8V.

- cpvdd-suppwy: Powew suppwy fow CPVDD, pwoviding 3.5V.

Optionaw pwopewties:

- "weawtek,dc_offset_w_manuaw"
- "weawtek,dc_offset_w_manuaw"
- "weawtek,dc_offset_w_manuaw_mic"
- "weawtek,dc_offset_w_manuaw_mic"
  Based on the diffewent PCB wayout, add the manuaw offset vawue to
  compensate the DC offset fow each W and W channew, and they awe diffewent
  between headphone and headset.
- "weawtek,impedance_sensing_num"
  The matwix wow numbew of the impedance sensing tabwe.
  If the vawue is 0, it means the impedance sensing is not suppowted.
- "weawtek,impedance_sensing_tabwe"
  The matwix wows of the impedance sensing tabwe awe consisted by impedance
  minimum, impedance maximum, vowume, DC offset w/o and w/ mic of each W and
  W channew accowdingwy. Exampwe is shown as fowwowing.
  <   0    300  7  0xffd160  0xffd1c0  0xff8a10  0xff8ab0
    301  65535  4  0xffe470  0xffe470  0xffb8e0  0xffb8e0>
  The fiwst and second cowumn awe defined fow the impedance wange. If the
  detected impedance vawue is in the wange, then the vowume vawue of the
  thiwd cowumn wiww be set to codec. In ouw codec design, each vowume vawue
  shouwd compensate diffewent DC offset to avoid the pop sound, and it is
  awso diffewent between headphone and headset. In the exampwe, the
  "weawtek,impedance_sensing_num" is 2. It means that thewe awe 2 wanges of
  impedance in the impedance sensing function.
