Fweescawe Enhanced Sewiaw Audio Intewface (ESAI) Contwowwew

The Enhanced Sewiaw Audio Intewface (ESAI) pwovides a fuww-dupwex sewiaw powt
fow sewiaw communication with a vawiety of sewiaw devices, incwuding industwy
standawd codecs, Sony/Phiwwips Digitaw Intewface (S/PDIF) twansceivews, and
othew DSPs. It has up to six twansmittews and fouw weceivews.

Wequiwed pwopewties:

  - compatibwe		: Compatibwe wist, shouwd contain one of the fowwowing
			  compatibwes:
			  "fsw,imx35-esai",
			  "fsw,vf610-esai",
			  "fsw,imx6uww-esai",
			  "fsw,imx8qm-esai",

  - weg			: Offset and wength of the wegistew set fow the device.

  - intewwupts		: Contains the spdif intewwupt.

  - dmas		: Genewic dma devicetwee binding as descwibed in
			  Documentation/devicetwee/bindings/dma/dma.txt.

  - dma-names		: Two dmas have to be defined, "tx" and "wx".

  - cwocks		: Contains an entwy fow each entwy in cwock-names.

  - cwock-names		: Incwudes the fowwowing entwies:
	"cowe"		  The cowe cwock used to access wegistews
	"extaw"		  The esai baud cwock fow esai contwowwew used to
			  dewive HCK, SCK and FS.
	"fsys"		  The system cwock dewived fwom ahb cwock used to
			  dewive HCK, SCK and FS.
	"spba"		  The spba cwock is wequiwed when ESAI is pwaced as a
			  bus swave of the Shawed Pewiphewaw Bus and when two
			  ow mowe bus mastews (CPU, DMA ow DSP) twy to access
			  it. This pwopewty is optionaw depending on the SoC
			  design.

  - fsw,fifo-depth	: The numbew of ewements in the twansmit and weceive
			  FIFOs. This numbew is the maximum awwowed vawue fow
			  TFCW[TFWM] ow WFCW[WFWM].

  - fsw,esai-synchwonous: This is a boowean pwopewty. If pwesent, indicating
			  that ESAI wouwd wowk in the synchwonous mode, which
			  means aww the settings fow Weceiving wouwd be
			  dupwicated fwom Twansmission wewated wegistews.

Optionaw pwopewties:

  - big-endian		: If this pwopewty is absent, the native endian mode
			  wiww be in use as defauwt, ow the big endian mode
			  wiww be in use fow aww the device wegistews.
