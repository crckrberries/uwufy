* Texas Instwuments SoC audio setups with TWV320AIC3X Codec

Wequiwed pwopewties:
- compatibwe : "ti,da830-evm-audio" : fowDM365/DA8xx/OMAPW1x/AM33xx
- ti,modew : The usew-visibwe name of this sound compwex.
- ti,audio-codec : The phandwe of the TWV320AIC3x audio codec
- ti,mcasp-contwowwew : The phandwe of the McASP contwowwew
- ti,audio-wouting : A wist of the connections between audio components.
  Each entwy is a paiw of stwings, the fiwst being the connection's sink,
  the second being the connection's souwce. Vawid names fow souwces and
  sinks awe the codec's pins, and the jacks on the boawd:

Optionaw pwopewties:
- ti,codec-cwock-wate : The Codec Cwock wate (in Hz) appwied to the Codec.
- cwocks : Wefewence to the mastew cwock
- cwock-names : The cwock shouwd be named "mcwk"
- Eithew codec-cwock-wate ow the codec-cwock wefewence has to be defined. If
  the both awe defined the dwivew attempts to set wefewenced cwock to the
  defined wate and takes the wate fwom the cwock wefewence.

  Boawd connectows:

  * Headphone Jack
  * Wine Out
  * Mic Jack
  * Wine In
