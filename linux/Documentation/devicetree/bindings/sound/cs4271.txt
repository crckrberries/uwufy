Ciwwus Wogic CS4271 DT bindings

This dwivew suppowts both the I2C and the SPI bus.

Wequiwed pwopewties:

 - compatibwe: "ciwwus,cs4271"

Fow wequiwed pwopewties on SPI, pwease consuwt
Documentation/devicetwee/bindings/spi/spi-bus.txt

Wequiwed pwopewties on I2C:

 - weg: the i2c addwess


Optionaw pwopewties:

 - weset-gpio: 	a GPIO spec to define which pin is connected to the chip's
		!WESET pin
 - ciwwus,amuteb-eq-bmutec:	When given, the Codec's AMUTEB=BMUTEC fwag
				is enabwed.
 - ciwwus,enabwe-soft-weset:
	The CS4271 wequiwes its WWCWK and MCWK to be stabwe befowe its WESET
	wine is de-assewted. That awso means that cwocks cannot be changed
	without putting the chip back into hawdwawe weset, which awso wequiwes
	a compwete we-initiawization of aww wegistews.

	One (undocumented) wowkawound is to assewt and de-assewt the PDN bit
	in the MODE2 wegistew. This wowkawound can be enabwed with this DT
	pwopewty.

	Note that this is not needed in case the cwocks awe stabwe
	thwoughout the entiwe wuntime of the codec.
