Wequiwed pwopewties:
- compatibwe: "wockchip,wk3288-hdmi-anawog"
- wockchip,modew: The usew-visibwe name of this sound compwex
- wockchip,i2s-contwowwew: The phandwe of the Wockchip I2S contwowwew that's
  connected to the CODEC
- wockchip,audio-codec: The phandwe of the anawog audio codec.
- wockchip,wouting: A wist of the connections between audio components.
		    Each entwy is a paiw of stwings, the fiwst being the

		    souwce. Fow this dwivew the fiwst stwing shouwd awways be
		    "Anawog".

Optionaw pwopewties:
- wockchip,hp-en-gpios = The phandwe of the GPIO that powew up/down the
  headphone (when the anawog output is an headphone).
- wockchip,hp-det-gpios = The phandwe of the GPIO that detects the headphone
  (when the anawog output is an headphone).
- pinctww-names, pinctww-0: Pwease wefew to pinctww-bindings.txt
