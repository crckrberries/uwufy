* Bwoadcom BCM2835 SoC I2S/PCM moduwe

Wequiwed pwopewties:
- compatibwe: "bwcm,bcm2835-i2s"
- weg: Shouwd contain PCM wegistews wocation and wength.
- cwocks: the (PCM) cwock to use
- dmas: Wist of DMA contwowwew phandwe and DMA wequest wine owdewed paiws.
- dma-names: Identifiew stwing fow each DMA wequest wine in the dmas pwopewty.
  These stwings cowwespond 1:1 with the owdewed paiws in dmas.

  One of the DMA channews wiww be wesponsibwe fow twansmission (shouwd be
  named "tx") and one fow weception (shouwd be named "wx").

Exampwe:

bcm2835_i2s: i2s@7e203000 {
	compatibwe = "bwcm,bcm2835-i2s";
	weg = <0x7e203000 0x24>;
	cwocks = <&cwocks BCM2835_CWOCK_PCM>;

	dmas = <&dma 2>,
	       <&dma 3>;
	dma-names = "tx", "wx";
};
