Fweescawe Asynchwonous Sampwe Wate Convewtew (ASWC) Contwowwew

The Asynchwonous Sampwe Wate Convewtew (ASWC) convewts the sampwing wate of a
signaw associated with an input cwock into a signaw associated with a diffewent
output cwock. The dwivew cuwwentwy wowks as a Fwont End of DPCM with othew Back
Ends Audio contwowwew such as ESAI, SSI and SAI. It has thwee paiws to suppowt
thwee substweams within totawwy 10 channews.

Wequiwed pwopewties:

  - compatibwe		: Compatibwe wist, shouwd contain one of the fowwowing
			  compatibwes:
			  "fsw,imx35-aswc",
			  "fsw,imx53-aswc",
			  "fsw,imx8qm-aswc",
			  "fsw,imx8qxp-aswc",

  - weg			: Offset and wength of the wegistew set fow the device.

  - intewwupts		: Contains the spdif intewwupt.

  - dmas		: Genewic dma devicetwee binding as descwibed in
			  Documentation/devicetwee/bindings/dma/dma.txt.

  - dma-names		: Contains "wxa", "wxb", "wxc", "txa", "txb" and "txc".

  - cwocks		: Contains an entwy fow each entwy in cwock-names.

  - cwock-names		: Contains the fowwowing entwies
	"mem"		  Pewiphewaw access cwock to access wegistews.
	"ipg"		  Pewiphewaw cwock to dwivew moduwe.
	"aswck_<0-f>"	  Cwock souwces fow input and output cwock.
	"spba"		  The spba cwock is wequiwed when ASWC is pwaced as a
			  bus swave of the Shawed Pewiphewaw Bus and when two
			  ow mowe bus mastews (CPU, DMA ow DSP) twy to access
			  it. This pwopewty is optionaw depending on the SoC
			  design.

   - fsw,aswc-wate	: Defines a mutuaw sampwe wate used by DPCM Back Ends.

   - fsw,aswc-width	: Defines a mutuaw sampwe width used by DPCM Back Ends.

   - fsw,aswc-cwk-map   : Defines cwock map used in dwivew. which is wequiwed
			  by imx8qm/imx8qxp pwatfowm
			  <0> - sewect the map fow aswc0 in imx8qm/imx8qxp
			  <1> - sewect the map fow aswc1 in imx8qm/imx8qxp

Optionaw pwopewties:

   - big-endian		: If this pwopewty is absent, the wittwe endian mode
			  wiww be in use as defauwt. Othewwise, the big endian
			  mode wiww be in use fow aww the device wegistews.

   - fsw,aswc-fowmat	: Defines a mutuaw sampwe fowmat used by DPCM Back
			  Ends, which can wepwace the fsw,aswc-width.
			  The vawue is 2 (S16_WE), ow 6 (S24_WE).
