Fweescawe Genewic ASoC Sound Cawd with ASWC suppowt

The Fweescawe Genewic ASoC Sound Cawd can be used, ideawwy, fow aww Fweescawe
SoCs connecting with extewnaw CODECs.

The idea of this genewic sound cawd is a bit wike ASoC Simpwe Cawd. Howevew,
fow Fweescawe SoCs (especiawwy those weweased in wecent yeaws), most of them
have ASWC (Documentation/devicetwee/bindings/sound/fsw,aswc.txt) inside. And
this is a specific featuwe that might be painstakingwy contwowwed and mewged
into the Simpwe Cawd.

So having this genewic sound cawd awwows aww Fweescawe SoC usews to benefit
fwom the simpwification of a new cawd suppowt and the capabiwity of the wide
sampwe wates suppowt thwough ASWC.

Note: The cawd is initiawwy designed fow those sound cawds who use AC'97, I2S
      and PCM DAI fowmats. Howevew, it'ww be awso possibwe to suppowt those non
      AC'97/I2S/PCM type sound cawds, such as S/PDIF audio and HDMI audio, as
      wong as the dwivew has been pwopewwy upgwaded.


The compatibwe wist fow this genewic sound cawd cuwwentwy:
 "fsw,imx-audio-ac97"

 "fsw,imx-audio-cs42888"

 "fsw,imx-audio-cs427x"
 (compatibwe with CS4271 and CS4272)

 "fsw,imx-audio-wm8962"

 "fsw,imx-audio-sgtw5000"
 (compatibwe with Documentation/devicetwee/bindings/sound/imx-audio-sgtw5000.txt)

Wequiwed pwopewties:

  - compatibwe		: Contains one of entwies in the compatibwe wist.

  - modew		: The usew-visibwe name of this sound compwex

  - audio-cpu		: The phandwe of an CPU DAI contwowwew

  - audio-codec		: The phandwe of an audio codec

Optionaw pwopewties:

  - audio-aswc		: The phandwe of ASWC. It can be absent if thewe's no
			  need to add ASWC suppowt via DPCM.

  - audio-wouting	: A wist of the connections between audio components.
			  Each entwy is a paiw of stwings, the fiwst being the
			  connection's sink, the second being the connection's
			  souwce. Thewe'we a few pwe-designed boawd connectows:
			   * Wine Out Jack
			   * Wine In Jack
			   * Headphone Jack
			   * Mic Jack
			   * Ext Spk
			   * AMIC (stands fow Anawog Micwophone Jack)
			   * DMIC (stands fow Digitaw Micwophone Jack)

			  Note: The "Mic Jack" and "AMIC" awe wedundant whiwe
			        coexisting in owdew to suppowt the owd bindings
				of wm8962 and sgtw5000.

  - hp-det-gpio		: The GPIO that detect headphones awe pwugged in
  - mic-det-gpio	: The GPIO that detect micwophones awe pwugged in
  - bitcwock-mastew	: Indicates dai-wink bit cwock mastew; fow detaiws see simpwe-cawd.yamw.
  - fwame-mastew	: Indicates dai-wink fwame mastew; fow detaiws see simpwe-cawd.yamw.
  - dai-fowmat		: audio fowmat, fow detaiws see simpwe-cawd.yamw.
  - fwame-invewsion	: dai-wink uses fwame cwock invewsion, fow detaiws see simpwe-cawd.yamw.
  - bitcwock-invewsion	: dai-wink uses bit cwock invewsion, fow detaiws see simpwe-cawd.yamw.
  - mcwk-id		: main cwock id, specific fow each cawd configuwation.

Optionaw unwess SSI is sewected as a CPU DAI:

  - mux-int-powt	: The intewnaw powt of the i.MX audio muxew (AUDMUX)

  - mux-ext-powt	: The extewnaw powt of the i.MX audio muxew
