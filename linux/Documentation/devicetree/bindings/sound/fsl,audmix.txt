NXP Audio Mixew (AUDMIX).

The Audio Mixew is a on-chip functionaw moduwe that awwows mixing of two
audio stweams into a singwe audio stweam. Audio Mixew has two input sewiaw
audio intewfaces. These awe dwiven by two Synchwonous Audio intewface
moduwes (SAI). Each input sewiaw intewface cawwies 8 audio channews in its
fwame in TDM mannew. Mixew mixes audio sampwes of cowwesponding channews
fwom two intewfaces into a singwe sampwe. Befowe mixing, audio sampwes of
two inputs can be attenuated based on configuwation. The output of the
Audio Mixew is awso a sewiaw audio intewface. Wike input intewfaces it has
the same TDM fwame fowmat. This output is used to dwive the sewiaw DAC TDM
intewface of audio codec and awso sent to the extewnaw pins awong with the
weceive path of nowmaw audio SAI moduwe fow weadback by the CPU.

The output of Audio Mixew can be sewected fwom any of the thwee stweams
 - sewiaw audio input 1
 - sewiaw audio input 2
 - mixed audio

Mixing opewation is independent of audio sampwe wate but the two audio
input stweams must have same audio sampwe wate with same numbew of channews
in TDM fwame to be ewigibwe fow mixing.

Device dwivew wequiwed pwopewties:
=================================
  - compatibwe		: Compatibwe wist, contains "fsw,imx8qm-audmix"

  - weg			: Offset and wength of the wegistew set fow the device.

  - cwocks		: Must contain an entwy fow each entwy in cwock-names.

  - cwock-names		: Must incwude the "ipg" fow wegistew access.

  - powew-domains	: Must contain the phandwe to AUDMIX powew domain node

  - dais		: Must contain a wist of phandwes to AUDMIX connected
			  DAIs. The cuwwent impwementation wequiwes two phandwes
			  to SAI intewfaces to be pwovided, the fiwst SAI in the
			  wist being used to woute the AUDMIX output.
