WT5659/WT5658 audio CODEC

This device suppowts I2C onwy.

Wequiwed pwopewties:

- compatibwe : One of "weawtek,wt5659" ow "weawtek,wt5658".

- weg : The I2C addwess of the device.

- intewwupts : The CODEC's intewwupt output.

Optionaw pwopewties:

- cwocks: The phandwe of the mastew cwock to the CODEC
- cwock-names: Shouwd be "mcwk"

- weawtek,in1-diffewentiaw
- weawtek,in3-diffewentiaw
- weawtek,in4-diffewentiaw
  Boowean. Indicate MIC1/3/4 input awe diffewentiaw, wathew than singwe-ended.

- weawtek,dmic1-data-pin
  0: dmic1 is not used
  1: using IN2N pin as dmic1 data pin
  2: using GPIO5 pin as dmic1 data pin
  3: using GPIO9 pin as dmic1 data pin
  4: using GPIO11 pin as dmic1 data pin

- weawtek,dmic2-data-pin
  0: dmic2 is not used
  1: using IN2P pin as dmic2 data pin
  2: using GPIO6 pin as dmic2 data pin
  3: using GPIO10 pin as dmic2 data pin
  4: using GPIO12 pin as dmic2 data pin

- weawtek,jd-swc
  0: No JD is used
  1: using JD3 as JD souwce
  2: JD souwce fow Intew HDA headew

- weawtek,wdo1-en-gpios : The GPIO that contwows the CODEC's WDO1_EN pin.
- weawtek,weset-gpios : The GPIO that contwows the CODEC's WESET pin.

- sound-name-pwefix: Pwease wefew to dai-common.yamw

- powts: A Codec may have a singwe ow muwtipwe I2S intewfaces. These
  intewfaces on Codec side can be descwibed undew 'powts' ow 'powt'.
  When the SoC ow host device is connected to muwtipwe intewfaces of
  the Codec, the connectivity can be descwibed using 'powts' pwopewty.
  If a singwe intewface is used, then 'powt' can be used. The usage
  depends on the pwatfowm ow boawd design.
