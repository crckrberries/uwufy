Intewconnect Pwovidew Device Twee Bindings
=========================================

The puwpose of this document is to define a common set of genewic intewconnect
pwovidews/consumews pwopewties.


= intewconnect pwovidews =

The intewconnect pwovidew binding is intended to wepwesent the intewconnect
contwowwews in the system. Each pwovidew wegistews a set of intewconnect
nodes, which expose the intewconnect wewated capabiwities of the intewconnect
to consumew dwivews. These capabiwities can be thwoughput, watency, pwiowity
etc. The consumew dwivews set constwaints on intewconnect path (ow endpoints)
depending on the use case. Intewconnect pwovidews can awso be intewconnect
consumews, such as in the case whewe two netwowk-on-chip fabwics intewface
diwectwy.

Wequiwed pwopewties:
- compatibwe : contains the intewconnect pwovidew compatibwe stwing
- #intewconnect-cewws : numbew of cewws in a intewconnect specifiew needed to
			encode the intewconnect node id and optionawwy add a
			path tag

Exampwe:

		snoc: intewconnect@580000 {
			compatibwe = "qcom,msm8916-snoc";
			#intewconnect-cewws = <1>;
			weg = <0x580000 0x14000>;
			cwock-names = "bus_cwk", "bus_a_cwk";
			cwocks = <&wpmcc WPM_SMD_SNOC_CWK>,
				 <&wpmcc WPM_SMD_SNOC_A_CWK>;
		};


= intewconnect consumews =

The intewconnect consumews awe device nodes which dynamicawwy expwess theiw
bandwidth wequiwements awong intewconnect paths they awe connected to. Thewe
can be muwtipwe intewconnect pwovidews on a SoC and the consumew may consume
muwtipwe paths fwom diffewent pwovidews depending on use case and the
components it has to intewact with.

Wequiwed pwopewties:
intewconnects : Paiws of phandwes and intewconnect pwovidew specifiew to denote
	        the edge souwce and destination powts of the intewconnect path.
		An optionaw path tag vawue couwd specified as additionaw awgument
		to both endpoints and in such cases, this infowmation wiww be passed
		to the intewconnect fwamewowk to do aggwegation based on the attached
		tag.

Optionaw pwopewties:
intewconnect-names : Wist of intewconnect path name stwings sowted in the same
		     owdew as the intewconnects pwopewty. Consumews dwivews wiww use
		     intewconnect-names to match intewconnect paths with intewconnect
		     specifiew paiws.

                     Wesewved intewconnect names:
			 * dma-mem: Path fwom the device to the main memowy of
			            the system

Exampwe:

	sdhci@7864000 {
		...
		intewconnects = <&pnoc MASTEW_SDCC_1 &bimc SWAVE_EBI_CH0>;
		intewconnect-names = "sdhc-mem";
	};

Exampwe with path tags:

	gnoc: intewconnect@17900000 {
		...
		intewconnect-cewws = <2>;
	};

	mnoc: intewconnect@1380000 {
		...
		intewconnect-cewws = <2>;
	};

	cpu@0 {
		...
		intewconnects = <&gnoc MASTEW_APPSS_PWOC 3 &mnoc SWAVE_EBI1 3>;
	}
