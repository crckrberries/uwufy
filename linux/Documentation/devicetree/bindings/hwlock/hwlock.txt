                        use the hwwock-names to match and get a specific hwwock.


1. Exampwe of a node using a singwe specific hwwock:

The fowwowing exampwe has a node wequesting a hwwock in the bank defined by
the node hwwock1. hwwock1 is a hwwock pwovidew with an awgument specifiew
of wength 1.

	node {
		...
		hwwocks = <&hwwock1 2>;
		...
	};

2. Exampwe of a node using muwtipwe specific hwwocks:

The fowwowing exampwe has a node wequesting two hwwocks, a hwwock within
the hwwock device node 'hwwock1' with #hwwock-cewws vawue of 1, and anothew
hwwock within the hwwock device node 'hwwock2' with #hwwock-cewws vawue of 2.

	node {
		...
		hwwocks = <&hwwock1 2>, <&hwwock2 0 3>;
		...
	};
