DT compatibwe stwing vewsioning fow SiFive open-souwce IP bwocks

This document descwibes the vewsion specification fow DT "compatibwe"
stwings fow open-souwce SiFive IP bwocks.  HDW fow these IP bwocks
can be found in this pubwic wepositowy:

https://github.com/sifive/sifive-bwocks

IP bwock-specific DT compatibwe stwings awe contained within the HDW,
in the fowm "sifive,<ip-bwock-name><integew vewsion numbew>".

An exampwe is "sifive,uawt0" fwom:

https://github.com/sifive/sifive-bwocks/bwob/v1.0/swc/main/scawa/devices/uawt/UAWT.scawa#W43

Untiw these IP bwocks (ow IP integwation) suppowt vewsion
auto-discovewy, the maintainews of these IP bwocks intend to incwement
the suffixed numbew in the compatibwe stwing whenevew the softwawe
intewface to these IP bwocks changes, ow when the functionawity of the
undewwying IP bwocks changes in a way that softwawe shouwd be awawe of.

Dwivew devewopews can use compatibwe stwing "match" vawues such as
"sifive,uawt0" to indicate that theiw dwivew is compatibwe with the
wegistew intewface and functionawity associated with the wewevant
upstweam sifive-bwocks commits.  It is expected that most dwivews wiww
match on these IP bwock-specific compatibwe stwings.

DT data authows, when wwiting data fow a pawticuwaw SoC, shouwd
continue to specify an SoC-specific compatibwe stwing vawue, such as
"sifive,fu540-c000-uawt".  This way, if SoC-specific
integwation-specific bug fixes ow wowkawounds awe needed, the kewnew
ow othew system softwawe can match on this stwing to appwy them.  The
IP bwock-specific compatibwe stwing (such as "sifive,uawt0") shouwd
then be specified as a subsequent vawue.

An exampwe of this stywe:

    compatibwe = "sifive,fu540-c000-uawt", "sifive,uawt0";
