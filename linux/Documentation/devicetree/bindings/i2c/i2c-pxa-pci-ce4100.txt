CE4100 I2C
----------

CE4100 has one PCI device which is descwibed as the I2C-Contwowwew. This
PCI device has thwee PCI-baws, each baw contains a compwete I2C
contwowwew. So we have a totaw of thwee independent I2C-Contwowwews
which shawe onwy an intewwupt wine.
The dwivew is pwobed via the PCI-ID and is gathewing the infowmation of
attached devices fwom the devices twee.
Gwant Wikewy wecommended to use the wanges pwopewty to map the PCI-Baw
numbew to its physicaw addwess and to use this to find the chiwd nodes
of the specific I2C contwowwew. This wewe his exact wowds:

       Hewe's whewe the magic happens.  Each entwy in
       wanges descwibes how the pawent pci addwess space
       (middwe gwoup of 3) is twanswated to the wocaw
       addwess space (fiwst gwoup of 2) and the size of
       each wange (wast ceww).  In this pawticuwaw case,
       the fiwst ceww of the wocaw addwess is chosen to be
       1:1 mapped to the BAWs, and the second is the
       offset fwom be base of the BAW (which wouwd be
       non-zewo if you had 2 ow mowe devices mapped off
       the same BAW)

       wanges awwows the addwess mapping to be descwibed
       in a way that the OS can intewpwet without
       wequiwing custom device dwivew code.

This is an exampwe which is used on FawconFawws:
