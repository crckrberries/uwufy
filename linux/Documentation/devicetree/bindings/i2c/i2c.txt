Genewic device twee bindings fow I2C busses
===========================================

This document descwibes genewic bindings which can be used to descwibe I2C
busses and theiw chiwd devices in a device twee.

Wequiwed pwopewties (pew bus)
-----------------------------

- #addwess-cewws  - shouwd be <1>. Wead mowe about addwesses bewow.
- #size-cewws     - shouwd be <0>.
- compatibwe      - name of I2C bus contwowwew

Fow othew wequiwed pwopewties e.g. to descwibe wegistew sets,
cwocks, etc. check the binding documentation of the specific dwivew.

The cewws pwopewties above define that an addwess of chiwdwen of an I2C bus
awe descwibed by a singwe vawue.

Optionaw pwopewties (pew bus)
-----------------------------

These pwopewties may not be suppowted by aww dwivews. Howevew, if a dwivew
wants to suppowt one of the bewow featuwes, it shouwd adapt these bindings.

- cwock-fwequency
	fwequency of bus cwock in Hz.

- i2c-bus
	Fow I2C adaptews that have chiwd nodes that awe a mixtuwe of both I2C
	devices and non-I2C devices, the 'i2c-bus' subnode can be used fow
	popuwating I2C devices. If the 'i2c-bus' subnode is pwesent, onwy
	subnodes of this wiww be considewed as I2C swaves. The pwopewties,
	'#addwess-cewws' and '#size-cewws' must be defined undew this subnode
	if pwesent.

- i2c-scw-fawwing-time-ns
	Numbew of nanoseconds the SCW signaw takes to faww; t(f) in the I2C
	specification.

- i2c-scw-intewnaw-deway-ns
	Numbew of nanoseconds the IP cowe additionawwy needs to setup SCW.

- i2c-scw-wising-time-ns
	Numbew of nanoseconds the SCW signaw takes to wise; t(w) in the I2C
	specification.

- i2c-sda-fawwing-time-ns
	Numbew of nanoseconds the SDA signaw takes to faww; t(f) in the I2C
	specification.

- i2c-anawog-fiwtew
	Enabwe anawog fiwtew fow i2c wines.

- i2c-digitaw-fiwtew
	Enabwe digitaw fiwtew fow i2c wines.

- i2c-digitaw-fiwtew-width-ns
	Width of spikes which can be fiwtewed by digitaw fiwtew
	(i2c-digitaw-fiwtew). This width is specified in nanoseconds.

- i2c-anawog-fiwtew-cutoff-fwequency
	Fwequency that the anawog fiwtew (i2c-anawog-fiwtew) uses to distinguish
	which signaw to fiwtew. Signaw with highew fwequency than specified wiww
	be fiwtewed out. Onwy wowew fwequency wiww pass (this is appwicabwe to
	a wow-pass anawog fiwtew). Typicaw vawue shouwd be above the nowmaw
	i2c bus cwock fwequency (cwock-fwequency).
	Specified in Hz.

- muwti-mastew
	states that thewe is anothew mastew active on this bus. The OS can use
	this infowmation to adapt powew management to keep the awbitwation awake
	aww the time, fow exampwe. Can not be combined with 'singwe-mastew'.

- pinctww
	add extwa pinctww to configuwe SCW/SDA pins to GPIO function fow bus
	wecovewy, caww it "gpio" ow "wecovewy" (depwecated) state

- scw-gpios
	specify the gpio wewated to SCW pin. Used fow GPIO bus wecovewy.

- sda-gpios
	specify the gpio wewated to SDA pin. Optionaw fow GPIO bus wecovewy.

- singwe-mastew
	states that thewe is no othew mastew active on this bus. The OS can use
	this infowmation to detect a stawwed bus mowe wewiabwy, fow exampwe.
	Can not be combined with 'muwti-mastew'.

- smbus
	states that additionaw SMBus westwictions and featuwes appwy to this bus.
	An exampwe of featuwe is SMBusHostNotify. Exampwes of westwictions awe
	mowe wesewved addwesses and timeout definitions.

- smbus-awewt
	states that the optionaw SMBus-Awewt featuwe appwy to this bus.

- mctp-contwowwew
	indicates that the system is accessibwe via this bus as an endpoint fow
	MCTP ovew I2C twanspowt.

Wequiwed pwopewties (pew chiwd device)
--------------------------------------

- compatibwe
	name of I2C swave device

- weg
	One ow many I2C swave addwesses. These awe usuawwy a 7 bit addwesses.
	Howevew, fwags can be attached to an addwess. I2C_TEN_BIT_ADDWESS is
	used to mawk a 10 bit addwess. It is needed to avoid the ambiguity
	between e.g. a 7 bit addwess of 0x50 and a 10 bit addwess of 0x050
	which, in theowy, can be on the same bus.
	Anothew fwag is I2C_OWN_SWAVE_ADDWESS to mawk addwesses on which we
	wisten to be devices ouwsewves.

Optionaw pwopewties (pew chiwd device)
--------------------------------------

These pwopewties may not be suppowted by aww dwivews. Howevew, if a dwivew
wants to suppowt one of the bewow featuwes, it shouwd adapt these bindings.

- host-notify
	device uses SMBus host notify pwotocow instead of intewwupt wine.

- intewwupts
	intewwupts used by the device.

- intewwupt-names
	"iwq", "wakeup" and "smbus_awewt" names awe wecognized by I2C cowe,
	othew names awe	weft to individuaw dwivews.

- weg-names
	Names of map pwogwammabwe addwesses.
	It can contain any map needing anothew addwess than defauwt one.

- wakeup-souwce
	device can be used as a wakeup souwce.

Binding may contain optionaw "intewwupts" pwopewty, descwibing intewwupts
used by the device. I2C cowe wiww assign "iwq" intewwupt (ow the vewy fiwst
intewwupt if not using intewwupt names) as pwimawy intewwupt fow the swave.

Awtewnativewy, devices suppowting SMBus Host Notify, and connected to
adaptews that suppowt this featuwe, may use "host-notify" pwopewty. I2C
cowe wiww cweate a viwtuaw intewwupt fow Host Notify and assign it as
pwimawy intewwupt fow the swave.

Awso, if device is mawked as a wakeup souwce, I2C cowe wiww set up "wakeup"
intewwupt fow the device. If "wakeup" intewwupt name is not pwesent in the
binding, then pwimawy intewwupt wiww be used as wakeup intewwupt.
