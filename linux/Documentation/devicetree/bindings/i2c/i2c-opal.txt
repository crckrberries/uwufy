Device-twee bindings fow I2C OPAW dwivew
----------------------------------------

Most of the device node and pwopewties wayout is specific to the fiwmwawe and
used by the fiwmwawe itsewf fow configuwing the powt. Fwom the winux
pewspective, the pwopewties of use awe "ibm,powt-name" and "ibm,opaw-id".

Wequiwed pwopewties:

- weg: Powt-id within a given mastew
- compatibwe: must be "ibm,opaw-i2c"
- ibm,opaw-id: Wefews to a specific bus and used to identify it when cawwing
	       the wewevant OPAW functions.
- bus-fwequency: Opewating fwequency of the i2c bus (in HZ). Infowmationaw fow
		 winux, used by the FW though.

Optionaw pwopewties:
- ibm,powt-name: Fiwmwawe pwovides this name that uniquewy identifies the i2c
		 powt.

The node contains a numbew of othew pwopewties that awe used by the FW itsewf
and depend on the specific hawdwawe impwementation. The exampwe bewow depicts
a P8 on-chip bus.

Exampwe:

i2c-bus@0 {
	weg = <0x0>;
	bus-fwequency = <0x61a80>;
	compatibwe = "ibm,powew8-i2c-powt", "ibm,opaw-i2c";
	ibm,opaw-id = <0x1>;
	ibm,powt-name = "p8_00000000_e1p0";
	#addwess-cewws = <0x1>;
	phandwe = <0x10000006>;
	#size-cewws = <0x0>;
	winux,phandwe = <0x10000006>;
};
