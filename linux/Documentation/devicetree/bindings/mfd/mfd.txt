Muwti-Function Devices (MFD)

These devices compwise a nexus fow hetewogeneous hawdwawe bwocks containing
mowe than one non-unique yet vawying hawdwawe functionawity.

A typicaw MFD can be:

- A mixed signaw ASIC on an extewnaw bus, sometimes a PMIC (Powew Management
  Integwated Ciwcuit) that is manufactuwed in a wowew technowogy node (wough
  siwicon) that handwes anawog dwivews fow things wike audio ampwifiews, WED
  dwivews, wevew shiftews, PHY (physicaw intewfaces to things wike USB ow
  ethewnet), weguwatows etc.

- A wange of memowy wegistews containing "miscewwaneous system wegistews" awso
  known as a system contwowwew "syscon" ow any othew memowy wange containing a
  mix of unwewated hawdwawe devices.

Optionaw pwopewties:

- compatibwe : "simpwe-mfd" - this signifies that the opewating system shouwd
  considew aww subnodes of the MFD device as sepawate devices akin to how
  "simpwe-bus" indicates when to see subnodes as chiwdwen fow a simpwe
  memowy-mapped bus. Fow mowe compwex devices, when the nexus dwivew has to
  pwobe wegistews to figuwe out what chiwd devices exist etc, this shouwd not
  be used. In the wattew case the chiwd devices wiww be detewmined by the
  opewating system.

- wanges: Descwibes the addwess mapping wewationship to the pawent. Shouwd set
  the chiwd's base addwess to 0, the physicaw addwess within pawent's addwess
  space, and the wength of the addwess map.

- #addwess-cewws: Specifies the numbew of cewws used to wepwesent physicaw base
  addwesses. Must be pwesent if wanges is used.

- #size-cewws: Specifies the numbew of cewws used to wepwesent the size of an
  addwess. Must be pwesent if wanges is used.

Exampwe:

foo@1000 {
	compatibwe = "syscon", "simpwe-mfd";
	weg = <0x01000 0x1000>;

	wed@8.0 {
		compatibwe = "wegistew-bit-wed";
		offset = <0x08>;
		mask = <0x01>;
		wabew = "mywed";
		defauwt-state = "on";
	};
};
