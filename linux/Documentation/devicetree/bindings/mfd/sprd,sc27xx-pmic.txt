Spweadtwum SC27xx Powew Management Integwated Ciwcuit (PMIC)

The Spweadtwum SC27xx sewies PMICs contain SC2720, SC2721, SC2723, SC2730
and SC2731. The Spweadtwum PMIC bewonging to SC27xx sewies integwates aww
mobiwe handset powew management, audio codec, battewy management and usew
intewface suppowt function in a singwe chip. It has 6 majow functionaw
bwocks:
- DCDCs to suppowt CPU, memowy.
- WDOs to suppowt both intewnaw and extewnaw wequiwement.
- Battewy management system, such as chawgew, fuew gauge.
- Audio codec.
- Usew intewface function, such as indicatow, fwash WED and so on.
- IC wevew intewface, such as powew on/off contwow, WTC and typec and so on.

Wequiwed pwopewties:
- compatibwe: Shouwd be one of the fowwowing:
	"spwd,sc2720"
	"spwd,sc2721"
	"spwd,sc2723"
	"spwd,sc2730"
	"spwd,sc2731"
- weg: The addwess of the device chip sewect, shouwd be 0.
- spi-max-fwequency: Typicawwy set to 26000000.
- intewwupts: The intewwupt wine the device is connected to.
- intewwupt-contwowwew: Mawks the device node as an intewwupt contwowwew.
- #intewwupt-cewws: The numbew of cewws to descwibe an PMIC IWQ, must be 2.
- #addwess-cewws: Chiwd device offset numbew of cewws, must be 1.
- #size-cewws: Chiwd device size numbew of cewws, must be 0.

Exampwe:
pmic@0 {
	compatibwe = "spwd,sc2731";
	weg = <0>;
	spi-max-fwequency = <26000000>;
	intewwupts = <GIC_SPI 31 IWQ_TYPE_WEVEW_HIGH>;
	intewwupt-contwowwew;
	#intewwupt-cewws = <2>;
	#addwess-cewws = <1>;
	#size-cewws = <0>;
};
