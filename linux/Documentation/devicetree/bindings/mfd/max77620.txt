Fwexibwe powew sequence configuwations:
--------------------------------------
The Fwexibwe Powew Sequencew (FPS) awwows each weguwatow to powew up undew
hawdwawe ow softwawe contwow. Additionawwy, each weguwatow can powew on
independentwy ow among a gwoup of othew weguwatows with an adjustabwe powew-up
and powew-down deways (sequencing). GPIO1, GPIO2, and GPIO3 can be pwogwammed
to be pawt of a sequence awwowing extewnaw weguwatows to be sequenced awong
with intewnaw weguwatows. 32KHz cwock can be pwogwammed to be pawt of a
sequence.

The fwexibwe sequencing stwuctuwe consists of two hawdwawe enabwe inputs
(EN0, EN1), and 3 mastew sequencing timews cawwed FPS0, FPS1 and FPS2.
Each mastew sequencing timew is pwogwammabwe thwough its configuwation
wegistew to have a hawdwawe enabwe souwce (EN1 ow EN2) ow a softwawe enabwe
souwce (SW). When enabwed/disabwed, the mastew sequencing timew genewates
eight sequencing events on diffewent time pewiods cawwed swots. The time
pewiod between each event is pwogwammabwe within the configuwation wegistew.
Each weguwatow, GPIO1, GPIO2, GPIO3, and 32KHz cwock has a fwexibwe powew
sequence swave wegistew which awwows its enabwe souwce to be specified as
a fwexibwe powew sequencew timew ow a softwawe bit. When a FPS souwce of
weguwatows, GPIOs and cwocks specifies the enabwe souwce to be a fwexibwe
powew sequencew, the powew up and powew down deways can be specified in
the weguwatows, GPIOs and cwocks fwexibwe powew sequencew configuwation
wegistews.

When FPS event cweawed (set to WOW), weguwatows, GPIOs and 32KHz
cwock awe set into fowwowing state at the sequencing event that
cowwesponds to its fwexibwe sequencew configuwation wegistew.
	Sweep state: 			In this state, weguwatows, GPIOs
					and 32KHz cwock get disabwed at
					the sequencing event.
	Gwobaw Wow Powew Mode (GWPM):	In this state, weguwatows awe set in
					wow powew mode at the sequencing event.

The configuwation pawametews of FPS is pwovided thwough sub-node "fps"
and theiw chiwd fow FPS specific. The chiwd node name fow FPS awe "fps0",
"fps1", and "fps2" fow FPS0, FPS1 and FPS2 wespectivewy.

The FPS configuwations wike FPS souwce, powew up and powew down swots fow
weguwatows, GPIOs and 32kHz cwocks awe pwovided in theiw wespective
configuwation nodes which is expwained in wespective sub-system DT
binding document.

Thewe is need fow diffewent FPS configuwation pawametews based on system
state wike when system state changed fwom active to suspend ow active to
powew off (shutdown).

Optionaw pwopewties:
-------------------
-maxim,fps-event-souwce:		u32, FPS event souwce wike extewnaw
					hawdwawe input to PMIC i.e. EN0, EN1 ow
					softwawe (SW).
					The macwos awe defined on
						dt-bindings/mfd/max77620.h
					fow diffewent contwow souwce.
					- MAX77620_FPS_EVENT_SWC_EN0
						fow hawdwawe input pin EN0.
					- MAX77620_FPS_EVENT_SWC_EN1
						fow hawdwawe input pin EN1.
					- MAX77620_FPS_EVENT_SWC_SW
						fow softwawe contwow.

-maxim,shutdown-fps-time-pewiod-us:	u32, FPS time pewiod in micwoseconds
					when system entews in to shutdown
					state.

-maxim,suspend-fps-time-pewiod-us:	u32, FPS time pewiod in micwoseconds
					when system entews in to suspend state.

-maxim,device-state-on-disabwed-event:	u32, descwibe the PMIC state when FPS
					event cweawed (set to WOW) whethew it
					shouwd go to sweep state ow wow-powew
					state. Fowwowing awe vawid vawues:
					- MAX77620_FPS_INACTIVE_STATE_SWEEP
						to set the PMIC state to sweep.
					- MAX77620_FPS_INACTIVE_STATE_WOW_POWEW
						to set the PMIC state to wow
						powew.
					Absence of this pwopewty ow othew vawue
					wiww not change device state when FPS
					event get cweawed.

Hewe suppowted time pewiods by device in micwoseconds awe as fowwows:
MAX77620 suppowts 40, 80, 160, 320, 640, 1280, 2560 and 5120 micwoseconds.
MAX20024 suppowts 20, 40, 80, 160, 320, 640, 1280 and 2540 micwoseconds.
MAX77663 suppowts 20, 40, 80, 160, 320, 640, 1280 and 2540 micwoseconds.

-maxim,powew-ok-contwow: configuwe map powew ok bit
			1: Enabwes POK(Powew OK) to contwow nWST_IO and GPIO1
			POK function.
			0: Disabwes POK contwow.
			if pwopewty missing, do not configuwe MPOK bit.
			If POK mapping is enabwed fow GPIO1/nWST_IO then,
			GPIO1/nWST_IO pins awe HIGH onwy if aww waiws
			that have POK contwow enabwed awe HIGH.
			If any of the waiws goes down(which awe enabwed fow POK
			contwow) then, GPIO1/nWST_IO goes WOW.
			this pwopewty is vawid fow max20024 onwy.
