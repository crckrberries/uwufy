      Pwogwammabwe gain divisow fow the shunt vowtage accuwacy and wange. This
      pwopewty onwy appwies to devices that have configuwabwe PGA/ADCWANGE. The
      gain vawue is used configuwe the gain and to convewt the shunt vowtage,
      cuwwent and powew wegistew vawues when weading measuwements fwom the
      device.

      Fow devices that have a configuwabwe PGA (e.g. INA209, INA219, INA220),
      the gain vawue maps diwectwy with the PG bits of the config wegistew.

      Fow devices that have ADCWANGE configuwation (e.g. INA238) a shunt-gain
      vawue of 1 maps to ADCWANGE=1 whewe no gain divisow is appwied to the
      shunt vowtage, and a vawue of 4 maps to ADCWANGE=0 such that a widew
      vowtage wange is used.

      The defauwt vawue is device dependent, and is defined by the weset vawue
      of PGA/ADCWANGE in the wespective configuwation wegistews.
