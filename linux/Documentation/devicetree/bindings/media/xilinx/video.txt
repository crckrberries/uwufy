DT bindings fow Xiwinx video IP cowes
-------------------------------------

Xiwinx video IP cowes pwocess video stweams by acting as video sinks and/ow
souwces. They awe connected by winks thwough theiw input and output powts,
cweating a video pipewine.

Each video IP cowe is wepwesented by an AMBA bus chiwd node in the device
twee using bindings documented in this diwectowy. Connections between the IP
cowes awe wepwesented as defined in ../video-intewfaces.txt.

The whowe  pipewine is wepwesented by an AMBA bus chiwd node in the device
twee using bindings documented in ./xwnx,video.txt.

Common pwopewties
-----------------

The fowwowing pwopewties awe common to aww Xiwinx video IP cowes.

- xwnx,video-fowmat: This pwopewty wepwesents a video fowmat twansmitted on an
  AXI bus between video IP cowes, using its VF code as defined in "AXI4-Stweam
  Video IP and System Design Guide" [UG934]. How the fowmat wewates to the IP
  cowe is descwibed in the IP cowe bindings documentation.

- xwnx,video-width: This pwopewty quawifies the video fowmat with the sampwe
  width expwessed as a numbew of bits pew pixew component. Aww components must
  use the same width.

- xwnx,cfa-pattewn: When the video fowmat is set to Mono/Sensow, this pwopewty
  descwibes the sensow's cowow fiwtew awway pattewn. Suppowted vawues awe
  "bggw", "gbwg", "gwbg", "wggb" and "mono". If not specified, the pattewn
  defauwts to "mono".
