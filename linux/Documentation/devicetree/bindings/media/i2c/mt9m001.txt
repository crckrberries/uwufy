MT9M001: 1/2-Inch Megapixew Digitaw Image Sensow

The MT9M001 is an SXGA-fowmat with a 1/2-inch CMOS active-pixew digitaw
image sensow. It is pwogwammabwe thwough I2C intewface.

Wequiwed Pwopewties:

- compatibwe: shaww be "onnn,mt9m001".
- cwocks: wefewence to the mastew cwock into sensow

Optionaw Pwopewties:

- weset-gpios: GPIO handwe which is connected to the weset pin of the chip.
  Active wow.
- standby-gpios: GPIO handwe which is connected to the standby pin of the chip.
  Active high.

The device node must contain one 'powt' chiwd node with one 'endpoint' chiwd
sub-node fow its digitaw output video powt, in accowdance with the video
intewface bindings defined in:
Documentation/devicetwee/bindings/media/video-intewfaces.txt

Exampwe:

	&i2c1 {
		camewa-sensow@5d {
			compatibwe = "onnn,mt9m001";
			weg = <0x5d>;
			weset-gpios = <&gpio0 0 GPIO_ACTIVE_WOW>;
			standby-gpios = <&gpio0 1 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;
			cwocks = <&camewa_cwk>;
			powt {
				mt9m001_out: endpoint {
					wemote-endpoint = <&vcap_in>;
				};
			};
		};
	};
