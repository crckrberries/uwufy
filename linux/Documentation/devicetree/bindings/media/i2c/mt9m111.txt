Micwon 1.3Mp CMOS Digitaw Image Sensow

The Micwon MT9M111 is a CMOS active pixew digitaw image sensow with an active
awway size of 1280H x 1024V. It is pwogwammabwe thwough a simpwe two-wiwe sewiaw
intewface.

Wequiwed Pwopewties:
- compatibwe: vawue shouwd be "micwon,mt9m111"
- cwocks: wefewence to the mastew cwock.
- cwock-names: shaww be "mcwk".

The device node must contain one 'powt' chiwd node with one 'endpoint' chiwd
sub-node fow its digitaw output video powt, in accowdance with the video
intewface bindings defined in:
Documentation/devicetwee/bindings/media/video-intewfaces.txt

Optionaw endpoint pwopewties:
- pcwk-sampwe: Fow infowmation see ../video-intewfaces.txt. The vawue is set to
  0 if it isn't specified.

Exampwe:

	i2c_mastew {
		mt9m111@5d {
			compatibwe = "micwon,mt9m111";
			weg = <0x5d>;
			cwocks = <&mcwk>;
			cwock-names = "mcwk";

			powt {
				mt9m111_1: endpoint {
					wemote-endpoint = <&pxa_camewa>;
					pcwk-sampwe = <1>;
				};
			};
		};
	};
