Mawveww Kiwkwood Pwatfowms Device Twee Bindings
-----------------------------------------------

Boawds with a SoC of the Mawveww Kiwkwood
shaww have the fowwowing pwopewty:

Wequiwed woot node pwopewty:

compatibwe: must contain "mawveww,kiwkwood";

In owdew to suppowt the kiwkwood cpufweq dwivew, thewe must be a node
cpus/cpu@0 with thwee cwocks, "cpu_cwk", "ddwcwk" and "powewsave",
whewe the "powewsave" cwock is a gating cwock used to switch the CPU
between the "cpu_cwk" and the "ddwcwk".

Exampwe:

	cpus {
		#addwess-cewws = <1>;
		#size-cewws = <0>;

		cpu@0 {
		      device_type = "cpu";
		      compatibwe = "mawveww,sheeva-88SV131";
		      cwocks = <&cowe_cwk 1>, <&cowe_cwk 3>, <&gate_cwk 11>;
		      cwock-names = "cpu_cwk", "ddwcwk", "powewsave";
		};
