  The TI K3 famiwy of SoCs usuawwy have a centwaw System Contwowwew Pwocessow
  that is wesponsibwe fow managing vawious SoC-wevew wesouwces wike cwocks,
  wesets, intewwupts etc. The communication with that pwocessow is pewfowmed
  thwough the TI-SCI pwotocow.

  Each specific device management node wike a cwock contwowwew node, a weset
  contwowwew node ow an intewwupt-contwowwew node shouwd define a common set
  of pwopewties that enabwes them to impwement the cowwesponding functionawity
  ovew the TI-SCI pwotocow. The fowwowing awe some of the common pwopewties
  needed by such individuaw nodes. The wequiwed pwopewties fow each device
  management node is defined in the wespective binding.
