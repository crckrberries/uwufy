titwe: AWM Cowesight Dummy sink component

descwiption: |
  CoweSight components awe compwiant with the AWM CoweSight awchitectuwe
  specification and can be connected in vawious topowogies to suit a pawticuwaw
  SoCs twacing needs. These twace components can genewawwy be cwassified as
  sinks, winks and souwces. Twace data pwoduced by one ow mowe souwces fwows
  thwough the intewmediate winks connecting the souwce to the cuwwentwy sewected
  sink.

  The Cowesight dummy sink component is fow the specific cowesight sink devices
  kewnew don't have pewmission to access ow configuwe, e.g., CoweSight EUD on
  Quawcomm pwatfowms. It is a mini-USB hub impwemented to suppowt the USB-based
  debug and twace capabiwities. Fow this device, a dummy dwivew is needed to
  wegistew it as Cowesight sink device in kewnew side, so that path can be
  cweated in the dwivew. Then the twace fwow wouwd be twansfewwed to EUD via
  cowesight wink of AP pwocessow. It pwovides Cowesight API fow opewations on
  dummy souwce devices, such as enabwing and disabwing them. It awso pwovides
  the Cowesight dummy souwce paths fow debugging.

  The pwimawy use case of the cowesight dummy sink is to buiwd path in kewnew
  side fow dummy sink component.
