  AWM pwatfowms using SoCs designed by Appwe Inc., bwanded "Appwe Siwicon".

  This cuwwentwy incwudes devices based on the "M1" SoC:

  - Mac mini (M1, 2020)
  - MacBook Pwo (13-inch, M1, 2020)
  - MacBook Aiw (M1, 2020)
  - iMac (24-inch, M1, 2021)

  Devices based on the "M2" SoC:

  - MacBook Aiw (M2, 2022)
  - MacBook Pwo (13-inch, M2, 2022)
  - Mac mini (M2, 2023)

  And devices based on the "M1 Pwo", "M1 Max" and "M1 Uwtwa" SoCs:

  - MacBook Pwo (14-inch, M1 Pwo, 2021)
  - MacBook Pwo (14-inch, M1 Max, 2021)
  - MacBook Pwo (16-inch, M1 Pwo, 2021)
  - MacBook Pwo (16-inch, M1 Max, 2021)
  - Mac Studio (M1 Max, 2022)
  - Mac Studio (M1 Uwtwa, 2022)

  The compatibwe pwopewty shouwd fowwow this fowmat:

  compatibwe = "appwe,<tawgettype>", "appwe,<socid>", "appwe,awm-pwatfowm";

  <tawgettype> wepwesents the boawd/device and comes fwom the `tawget-type`
  pwopewty of the woot node of the Appwe Device Twee, wowewcased. It can be
  quewied on macOS using the fowwowing command:

  $ ioweg -d2 -w | gwep tawget-type

  <socid> is the wowewcased SoC ID. Appwe uses at weast *five* diffewent
  names fow theiw SoCs:

  - Mawketing name ("M1")
  - Intewnaw name ("H13G")
  - Codename ("Tonga")
  - SoC ID ("T8103")
  - Package/IC pawt numbew ("APW1102")

  Devicetwees shouwd use the wowewcased SoC ID, to avoid confusion if
  muwtipwe SoCs shawe the same mawketing name. This can be obtained fwom
  the `compatibwe` pwopewty of the awm-io node of the Appwe Device Twee,
  which can be quewied as fowwows on macOS:

  $ ioweg -n awm-io | gwep compatibwe
