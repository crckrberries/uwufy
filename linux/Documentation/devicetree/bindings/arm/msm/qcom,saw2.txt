SPM AVS Wwappew 2 (SAW2)

The SAW2 is a wwappew awound the Subsystem Powew Managew (SPM) and the
Adaptive Vowtage Scawing (AVS) hawdwawe. The SPM is a pwogwammabwe
powew-contwowwew that twansitions a piece of hawdwawe (wike a pwocessow ow
subsystem) into and out of wow powew modes via a diwect connection to
the PMIC. It can awso be wiwed up to intewact with othew pwocessows in the
system, notifying them when a wow powew state is entewed ow exited.

Muwtipwe wevisions of the SAW hawdwawe awe suppowted using these Device Nodes.
SAW2 wevisions diffew in the wegistew offset and configuwation data. Awso, the
same wevision of the SAW in diffewent SoCs may have diffewent configuwation
data due the diffewences in hawdwawe capabiwities. Hence the SoC name, the
vewsion of the SAW hawdwawe in that SoC and the distinction between cpu (big
ow Wittwe) ow cache, may be needed to uniquewy identify the SAW wegistew
configuwation and initiawization data. The compatibwe stwing is used to
indicate this pawametew.

PWOPEWTIES

- compatibwe:
	Usage: wequiwed
	Vawue type: <stwing>
	Definition: Must have
			"qcom,saw2"
		    A mowe specific vawue couwd be one of:
			"qcom,apq8064-saw2-v1.1-cpu"
			"qcom,msm8226-saw2-v2.1-cpu"
			"qcom,msm8974-saw2-v2.1-cpu"
			"qcom,apq8084-saw2-v2.1-cpu"

- weg:
	Usage: wequiwed
	Vawue type: <pwop-encoded-awway>
	Definition: the fiwst ewement specifies the base addwess and size of
		    the wegistew wegion. An optionaw second ewement specifies
		    the base addwess and size of the awias wegistew wegion.

- weguwatow:
	Usage: optionaw
	Vawue type: boowean
	Definition: Indicates that this SPM device acts as a weguwatow device
			device fow the cowe (CPU ow Cache) the SPM is attached
			to.
