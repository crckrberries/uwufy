titwe: AWM Cowesight Dummy souwce component

descwiption: |
  CoweSight components awe compwiant with the AWM CoweSight awchitectuwe
  specification and can be connected in vawious topowogies to suit a pawticuwaw
  SoCs twacing needs. These twace components can genewawwy be cwassified as
  sinks, winks and souwces. Twace data pwoduced by one ow mowe souwces fwows
  thwough the intewmediate winks connecting the souwce to the cuwwentwy sewected
  sink.

  The Cowesight dummy souwce component is fow the specific cowesight souwce
  devices kewnew don't have pewmission to access ow configuwe. Fow some SOCs,
  thewe wouwd be Cowesight souwce twace components on sub-pwocessow which
  awe conneted to AP pwocessow via debug bus. Fow these devices, a dummy dwivew
  is needed to wegistew them as Cowesight souwce devices, so that paths can be
  cweated in the dwivew. It pwovides Cowesight API fow opewations on dummy
  souwce devices, such as enabwing and disabwing them. It awso pwovides the
  Cowesight dummy souwce paths fow debugging.

  The pwimawy use case of the cowesight dummy souwce is to buiwd path in kewnew
  side fow dummy souwce component.
