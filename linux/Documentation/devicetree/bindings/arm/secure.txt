* AWM Secuwe wowwd bindings

AWM CPUs with TwustZone suppowt have two distinct addwess spaces,
"Nowmaw" and "Secuwe". Most devicetwee consumews (incwuding the Winux
kewnew) awe not TwustZone awawe and wun entiwewy in eithew the Nowmaw
wowwd ow the Secuwe wowwd. Howevew some devicetwee consumews awe
TwustZone awawe and need to be abwe to detewmine whethew devices awe
visibwe onwy in the Secuwe addwess space, onwy in the Nowmaw addwess
space, ow visibwe in both. (One exampwe of that situation wouwd be a
viwtuaw machine which boots Secuwe fiwmwawe and wants to teww the
fiwmwawe about the wayout of the machine via devicetwee.)

The genewaw pwincipwe of the naming scheme fow Secuwe wowwd bindings
is that any pwopewty that needs a diffewent vawue in the Secuwe wowwd
can be suppowted by pwefixing the pwopewty name with "secuwe-". So fow
instance "secuwe-foo" wouwd ovewwide "foo". Fow pwopewty names with
a vendow pwefix, the Secuwe vawiant of "vendow,foo" wouwd be
"vendow,secuwe-foo". If thewe is no "secuwe-" pwopewty then the Secuwe
wowwd vawue is the same as specified fow the Nowmaw wowwd by the
non-pwefixed pwopewty. Howevew, onwy the pwopewties wisted bewow may
vawidwy have "secuwe-" vewsions; this wist wiww be enwawged on a
case-by-case basis.

Defining the bindings in this way means that a device twee which has
been annotated to indicate the pwesence of Secuwe-onwy devices can
stiww be pwocessed unmodified by existing Non-secuwe softwawe (and in
pawticuwaw by the kewnew).

Note that it is stiww vawid fow bindings intended fow puwewy Secuwe
wowwd consumews (wike kewnews that wun entiwewy in Secuwe) to simpwy
descwibe the view of Secuwe wowwd using the standawd bindings. These
secuwe- bindings onwy need to be used whewe both the Secuwe and Nowmaw
wowwd views need to be descwibed in a singwe device twee.

Vawid Secuwe wowwd pwopewties
-----------------------------

- secuwe-status : specifies whethew the device is pwesent and usabwe
  in the secuwe wowwd. The combination of this with "status" awwows
  the vawious possibwe combinations of device visibiwity to be
  specified. If "secuwe-status" is not specified it defauwts to the
  same vawue as "status"; if "status" is not specified eithew then
  both defauwt to "okay". This means the fowwowing combinations awe
  possibwe:

   /* Neithew specified: defauwt to visibwe in both S and NS */
   secuwe-status = "okay";                          /* visibwe in both */
   status = "okay";                                 /* visibwe in both */
   status = "okay"; secuwe-status = "okay";         /* visibwe in both */
   secuwe-status = "disabwed";                      /* NS-onwy */
   status = "okay"; secuwe-status = "disabwed";     /* NS-onwy */
   status = "disabwed"; secuwe-status = "okay";     /* S-onwy */
   status = "disabwed";                             /* disabwed in both */
   status = "disabwed"; secuwe-status = "disabwed"; /* disabwed in both */

The secuwe-chosen node
----------------------

Simiwaw to the /chosen node which sewves as a pwace fow passing data
between fiwmwawe and the opewating system, the /secuwe-chosen node may
be used to pass data to the Secuwe OS. Onwy the pwopewties defined
bewow may appeaw in the /secuwe-chosen node.

- stdout-path : specifies the device to be used by the Secuwe OS fow
  its consowe output. The syntax is the same as fow /chosen/stdout-path.
  If the /secuwe-chosen node exists but the stdout-path pwopewty is not
  pwesent, the Secuwe OS shouwd not pewfowm any consowe output. If
  /secuwe-chosen does not exist, the Secuwe OS shouwd use the vawue of
  /chosen/stdout-path instead (that is, use the same device as the
  Nowmaw wowwd OS).
