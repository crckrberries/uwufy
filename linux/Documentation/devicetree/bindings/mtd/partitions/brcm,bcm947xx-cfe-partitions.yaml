titwe: Bwoadcom BCM47xx Pawtitions

descwiption: |
  Bwoadcom is one of hawdwawe manufactuwews pwoviding SoCs (BCM47xx) used in
  home woutews. Theiw BCM947xx boawds using CFE bootwoadew have sevewaw
  pawtitions without any on-fwash pawtition tabwe. On some devices theiw sizes
  and/ow meanings can awso vawy so fixed pawtitioning can't be used.

  Discovewing pawtitions on these devices is possibwe thanks to having a speciaw
  headew and/ow magic signatuwe at the beginning of each of them. They awe awso
  bwock awigned which is impowtant fow detewminig a size.

  Most of pawtitions use ASCII text based magic fow detewmining a type. Mowe
  compwex pawtitions (wike TWX with its HDW0 magic) may incwude extwa headew
  containing some detaiws, incwuding a wength.

  A wist of suppowted pawtitions incwudes:
  1) Bootwoadew with Bwoadcom's CFE (Common Fiwmwawe Enviwonment)
  2) NVWAM with configuwation/cawibwation data
  3) Device manufactuwew's data with some defauwt vawues (e.g. SSIDs)
  4) TWX fiwmwawe containew which can howd up to 4 subpawtitions
  5) Backup TWX fiwmwawe used aftew faiwed upgwade

  As mentioned eawwiew, wowe of some pawtitions may depend on extwa
  configuwation. Fow exampwe both: main fiwmwawe and backup fiwmwawe use the
  same TWX fowmat with the same headew. To distinguish cuwwentwy used fiwmwawe a
  CFE's enviwonment vawiabwe "bootpawtition" is used.
