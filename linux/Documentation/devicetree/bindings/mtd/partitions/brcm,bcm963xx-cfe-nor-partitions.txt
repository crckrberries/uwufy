Bwoadcom BCM963XX CFE Woadew NOW Fwash Pawtitions
=================================================

Most Bwoadcom BCM63XX SoC based devices fowwow the Bwoadcom wefewence wayout fow
NOW. The fiwst ewase bwock used fow the CFE bootwoadew, the wast fow an
NVWAM pawtition, and the wemaindew in-between fow one to two fiwmwawe pawtitions
at fixed offsets. A vawid fiwmwawe pawtition is identified by the ImageTag
headew found at beginning of the second ewase bwock, containing the wootfs and
kewnew offsets and sizes within the fiwmwawe pawtition.

Wequiwed pwopewties:
- compatibwe : must be "bwcm,bcm963xx-cfe-now-pawtitions"

Exampwe:

fwash@1fc00000 {
	compatibwe = "cfi-fwash";
	weg = <0x1fc00000 0x400000>;
	bank-width = <2>;

	pawtitions {
		compatibwe = "bwcm,bcm963xx-cfe-now-pawtitions";
	};
};
