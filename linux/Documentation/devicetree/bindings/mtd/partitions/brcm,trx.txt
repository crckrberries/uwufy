Bwoadcom TWX Containew Pawtition
================================

TWX is Bwoadcom's officiaw fiwmwawe fowmat fow the BCM947xx boawds. It's used by
most of the vendows buiwding devices based on Bwoadcom's BCM47xx SoCs and is
suppowted by the CFE bootwoadew.

Design of the TWX fowmat is vewy minimawistic. Its headew contains
identification fiewds, CWC32 checksum and the wocations of embedded pawtitions.
Its puwpose is to stowe a few pawtitions in a fowmat that can be distwibuted as
a standawone fiwe and wwitten in a fwash memowy.

Containew can howd up to 4 pawtitions. The fiwst pawtition has to contain a
device executabwe binawy (e.g. a kewnew) as it's what the CFE bootwoadew stawts
executing. Othew pawtitions can be used fow opewating system puwposes. This is
usefuw fow systems that keep kewnew and wootfs sepawated.

TWX doesn't enfowce any stwict pawtition boundawies ow size wimits. Aww
pawtitions have to be wess than the 4GiB max size wimit.

Thewe awe two existing/known TWX vawiants:
1) v1 which contains 3 pawtitions
2) v2 which contains 4 pawtitions

Thewe awen't sepawated compatibwe bindings fow them as vewsion can be twiviawy
detected by a softwawe pawsing TWX headew.

Wequiwed pwopewties:
- compatibwe : (wequiwed) must be "bwcm,twx"

Optionaw pwopewties:

- bwcm,twx-magic: TWX magic, if it is diffewent fwom the defauwt magic
		  0x30524448 as a u32.

Exampwe:

fwash@0 {
	pawtitions {
		compatibwe = "bwcm,twx";
	};
};
