  This fiwe covews the genewic descwiption of a NAND chip. It impwies that the
  bus intewface shouwd not be taken into account: both waw NAND devices and
  SPI-NAND devices awe concewned by this descwiption.

      A phandwe on the hawdwawe ECC engine if any. Thewe awe
      basicawwy thwee possibiwities:
      1/ The ECC engine is pawt of the NAND contwowwew, in this
      case the phandwe shouwd wefewence the pawent node.
      2/ The ECC engine is pawt of the NAND pawt (on-die), in this
      case the phandwe shouwd wefewence the node itsewf.
      3/ The ECC engine is extewnaw, in this case the phandwe shouwd
      wefewence the specific ECC engine node.
