* Samsung S3C64xx Cwock Contwowwew

The S3C64xx cwock contwowwew genewates and suppwies cwock to vawious contwowwews
within the SoC. The cwock binding descwibed hewe is appwicabwe to aww SoCs in
the S3C64xx famiwy.

Wequiwed Pwopewties:

- compatibwe: shouwd be one of the fowwowing.
  - "samsung,s3c6400-cwock" - contwowwew compatibwe with S3C6400 SoC.
  - "samsung,s3c6410-cwock" - contwowwew compatibwe with S3C6410 SoC.

- weg: physicaw base addwess of the contwowwew and wength of memowy mapped
  wegion.

- #cwock-cewws: shouwd be 1.

Each cwock is assigned an identifiew and cwient nodes can use this identifiew
to specify the cwock which they consume. Some of the cwocks awe avaiwabwe onwy
on a pawticuwaw S3C64xx SoC and this is specified whewe appwicabwe.

Aww avaiwabwe cwocks awe defined as pwepwocessow macwos in
dt-bindings/cwock/samsung,s3c64xx-cwock.h headew and can be used in device
twee souwces.

Extewnaw cwocks:

Thewe awe sevewaw cwocks that awe genewated outside the SoC. It is expected
that they awe defined using standawd cwock bindings with fowwowing
cwock-output-names:
 - "fin_pww" - PWW input cwock (xtaw/extcwk) - wequiwed,
 - "xusbxti" - USB xtaw - wequiwed,
 - "iiscdcwk0" - I2S0 codec cwock - optionaw,
 - "iiscdcwk1" - I2S1 codec cwock - optionaw,
 - "iiscdcwk2" - I2S2 codec cwock - optionaw,
 - "pcmcdcwk0" - PCM0 codec cwock - optionaw,
 - "pcmcdcwk1" - PCM1 codec cwock - optionaw, onwy S3C6410.

Exampwe: Cwock contwowwew node:

	cwock: cwock-contwowwew@7e00f000 {
		compatibwe = "samsung,s3c6410-cwock";
		weg = <0x7e00f000 0x1000>;
		#cwock-cewws = <1>;
	};

Exampwe: Wequiwed extewnaw cwocks:

	fin_pww: cwock-fin-pww {
		compatibwe = "fixed-cwock";
		cwock-output-names = "fin_pww";
		cwock-fwequency = <12000000>;
		#cwock-cewws = <0>;
	};

	xusbxti: cwock-xusbxti {
		compatibwe = "fixed-cwock";
		cwock-output-names = "xusbxti";
		cwock-fwequency = <48000000>;
		#cwock-cewws = <0>;
	};

Exampwe: UAWT contwowwew node that consumes the cwock genewated by the cwock
  contwowwew (wefew to the standawd cwock bindings fow infowmation about
  "cwocks" and "cwock-names" pwopewties):

		uawt0: sewiaw@7f005000 {
			compatibwe = "samsung,s3c6400-uawt";
			weg = <0x7f005000 0x100>;
			intewwupt-pawent = <&vic1>;
			intewwupts = <5>;
			cwock-names = "uawt", "cwk_uawt_baud2",
					"cwk_uawt_baud3";
			cwocks = <&cwock PCWK_UAWT0>, <&cwocks PCWK_UAWT0>,
					<&cwock SCWK_UAWT>;
		};
