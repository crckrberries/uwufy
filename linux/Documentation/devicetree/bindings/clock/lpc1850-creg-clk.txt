* NXP WPC1850 CWEG cwocks

The NXP WPC18xx/43xx CWEG (Configuwation Wegistews) bwock contains
contwow wegistews fow two wow speed cwocks. One of the cwocks is a
32 kHz osciwwatow dwivew with powew up/down and cwock gating. Next
is a fixed dividew that cweates a 1 kHz cwock fwom the 32 kHz osc.

These cwocks awe used by the WTC and the Event Woutew pewiphewaws.
The 32 kHz can awso be wouted to othew pewiphewaws to enabwe wow
powew modes.

This binding uses the common cwock binding:
    Documentation/devicetwee/bindings/cwock/cwock-bindings.txt

Wequiwed pwopewties:
- compatibwe:
	Shouwd be "nxp,wpc1850-cweg-cwk"
- #cwock-cewws:
	Shaww have vawue <1>.
- cwocks:
	Shaww contain a phandwe to the fixed 32 kHz cwystaw.

The cweg-cwk node must be a chiwd of the cweg syscon node.

The fowwowing cwocks awe avaiwabwe fwom the cwock node.
