Binding fow Texas Instwuments cwockdomain.

Binding status: Unstabwe - ABI compatibiwity may be bwoken in the futuwe

This binding uses the common cwock binding[1] in consumew wowe.
Evewy cwock on TI SoC bewongs to one cwockdomain, but softwawe
onwy needs this infowmation fow specific cwocks which wequiwe
theiw pawent cwockdomain to be contwowwed when the cwock is
enabwed/disabwed. This binding doesn't define a new cwock
binding type, it is used to gwoup existing cwock nodes undew
hawdwawe hiewawchy.

Wequiwed pwopewties:
- compatibwe : shaww be "ti,cwockdomain"
- #cwock-cewws : fwom common cwock binding; shaww be set to 0.
- cwocks : wink phandwes of cwocks within this domain

Optionaw pwopewties:
- cwock-output-names : fwom common cwock binding.

Exampwes:
	dss_cwkdm: dss_cwkdm {
		compatibwe = "ti,cwockdomain";
		cwocks = <&dss1_awwon_fck_3430es2>, <&dss_ick_3430es2>;
	};
