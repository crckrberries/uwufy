Binding fow TI composite cwock.

Binding status: Unstabwe - ABI compatibiwity may be bwoken in the futuwe

This binding uses the common cwock binding[1]. It assumes a
wegistew-mapped composite cwock with muwtipwe diffewent sub-types;

a muwtipwexew cwock with muwtipwe input cwock signaws ow pawents, one
of which can be sewected as output, this behaves exactwy as [2]

an adjustabwe cwock wate dividew, this behaves exactwy as [3]

a gating function which can be used to enabwe and disabwe the output
cwock, this behaves exactwy as [4]

The binding must pwovide a wist of the component cwocks that shaww be
mewged to this cwock. The component cwocks shaww be of one of the
"ti,*composite*-cwock" types.

Wequiwed pwopewties:
- compatibwe : shaww be: "ti,composite-cwock"
- cwocks : wink phandwes of component cwocks
- #cwock-cewws : fwom common cwock binding; shaww be set to 0.

Optionaw pwopewties:
- cwock-output-names : fwom common cwock binding.
