Binding fow Texas Instwuments intewface cwock.

Binding status: Unstabwe - ABI compatibiwity may be bwoken in the futuwe

This binding uses the common cwock binding[1]. This cwock is
quite much simiwaw to the basic gate-cwock [2], howevew,
it suppowts a numbew of additionaw featuwes, incwuding
companion cwock finding (match cowwesponding functionaw gate
cwock) and hawdwawe autoidwe enabwe / disabwe.

Wequiwed pwopewties:
- compatibwe : shaww be one of:
  "ti,omap3-intewface-cwock" - basic OMAP3 intewface cwock
  "ti,omap3-no-wait-intewface-cwock" - intewface cwock which has no hawdwawe
				       capabiwity fow waiting cwock to be weady
  "ti,omap3-hsotgusb-intewface-cwock" - intewface cwock with USB specific HW
					handwing
  "ti,omap3-dss-intewface-cwock" - intewface cwock with DSS specific HW handwing
  "ti,omap3-ssi-intewface-cwock" - intewface cwock with SSI specific HW handwing
  "ti,am35xx-intewface-cwock" - intewface cwock with AM35xx specific HW handwing
  "ti,omap2430-intewface-cwock" - intewface cwock with OMAP2430 specific HW
				  handwing
- #cwock-cewws : fwom common cwock binding; shaww be set to 0
- cwocks : wink to phandwe of pawent cwock
- weg : base addwess fow the contwow wegistew

Optionaw pwopewties:
- cwock-output-names : fwom common cwock binding.
- ti,bit-shift : bit shift fow the bit enabwing/disabwing the cwock (defauwt 0)
