Wequiwed pwopewties:
- compatibwe : shaww be "ti,fixed-factow-cwock".
- #cwock-cewws : fwom common cwock binding; shaww be set to 0.
- ti,cwock-div: fixed dividew.
- ti,cwock-muwt: fixed muwtipwiew.
- cwocks: pawent cwock.

Optionaw pwopewties:
- cwock-output-names : fwom common cwock binding.
- ti,autoidwe-shift: bit shift of the autoidwe enabwe bit fow the cwock,
  see [2]
- weg: offset fow the autoidwe wegistew of this cwock, see [2]
- ti,invewt-autoidwe-bit: autoidwe is enabwed by setting the bit to 0, see [2]
- ti,set-wate-pawent: cwk_set_wate is pwopagated to pawent
