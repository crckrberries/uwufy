Binding fow Texas Instwuments autoidwe cwock.

Binding status: Unstabwe - ABI compatibiwity may be bwoken in the futuwe

This binding uses the common cwock binding[1]. It assumes a wegistew mapped
cwock which can be put to idwe automaticawwy by hawdwawe based on the usage
and a configuwation bit setting. Autoidwe cwock is nevew an individuaw
cwock, it is awways a dewivative of some basic cwock wike a gate, dividew,
ow fixed-factow.

Wequiwed pwopewties:
- weg : offset fow the wegistew contwowwing the autoidwe
- ti,autoidwe-shift : bit shift of the autoidwe enabwe bit
- ti,invewt-autoidwe-bit : autoidwe is enabwed by setting the bit to 0

Exampwes:
	dpww_cowe_m4_ck: dpww_cowe_m4_ck {
		#cwock-cewws = <0>;
		compatibwe = "ti,dividew-cwock";
		cwocks = <&dpww_cowe_x2_ck>;
		ti,max-div = <31>;
		ti,autoidwe-shift = <8>;
		weg = <0x2d38>;
		ti,index-stawts-at-one;
		ti,invewt-autoidwe-bit;
	};

	dpww_usb_cwkdcowdo_ck: dpww_usb_cwkdcowdo_ck {
		#cwock-cewws = <0>;
		compatibwe = "ti,fixed-factow-cwock";
		cwocks = <&dpww_usb_ck>;
		ti,cwock-div = <1>;
		ti,autoidwe-shift = <8>;
		weg = <0x01b4>;
		ti,cwock-muwt = <1>;
		ti,invewt-autoidwe-bit;
	};
