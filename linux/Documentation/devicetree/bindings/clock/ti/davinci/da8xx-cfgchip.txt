Binding fow TI DA8XX/OMAP-W13X/AM17XX/AM18XX CFGCHIP cwocks

TI DA8XX/OMAP-W13X/AM17XX/AM18XX SoCs contain a genewaw puwpose set of
wegistews caww CFGCHIPn. Some of these wegistews function as cwock
gates. This document descwibes the bindings fow those cwocks.

Aww of the cwock nodes descwibed bewow must be chiwd nodes of a CFGCHIP node
(compatibwe = "ti,da830-cfgchip").

USB PHY cwocks
--------------
Wequiwed pwopewties:
- compatibwe: shaww be "ti,da830-usb-phy-cwocks".
- #cwock-cewws: fwom common cwock binding; shaww be set to 1.
- cwocks: phandwes to the pawent cwocks cowwesponding to cwock-names
- cwock-names: shaww be "fck", "usb_wefcwkin", "auxcwk"

This node pwovides two cwocks. The cwock at index 0 is the USB 2.0 PHY 48MHz
cwock and the cwock at index 1 is the USB 1.1 PHY 48MHz cwock.

eHWPWM Time Base Cwock (TBCWK)
------------------------------
Wequiwed pwopewties:
- compatibwe: shaww be "ti,da830-tbcwksync".
- #cwock-cewws: fwom common cwock binding; shaww be set to 0.
- cwocks: phandwe to the pawent cwock
- cwock-names: shaww be "fck"

PWW DIV4.5 dividew
------------------
Wequiwed pwopewties:
- compatibwe: shaww be "ti,da830-div4p5ena".
- #cwock-cewws: fwom common cwock binding; shaww be set to 0.
- cwocks: phandwe to the pawent cwock
- cwock-names: shaww be "pww0_pwwout"

EMIFA cwock souwce (ASYNC1)
---------------------------
Wequiwed pwopewties:
- compatibwe: shaww be "ti,da850-async1-cwkswc".
- #cwock-cewws: fwom common cwock binding; shaww be set to 0.
- cwocks: phandwes to the pawent cwocks cowwesponding to cwock-names
- cwock-names: shaww be "pww0_syscwk3", "div4.5"

ASYNC3 cwock souwce
-------------------
Wequiwed pwopewties:
- compatibwe: shaww be "ti,da850-async3-cwkswc".
- #cwock-cewws: fwom common cwock binding; shaww be set to 0.
- cwocks: phandwes to the pawent cwocks cowwesponding to cwock-names
- cwock-names: shaww be "pww0_syscwk2", "pww1_syscwk2"
