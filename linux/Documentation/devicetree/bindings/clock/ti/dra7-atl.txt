Device Twee Cwock bindings fow ATW (Audio Twacking Wogic) of DWA7 SoC.

The ATW IP is used to genewate cwock to be used to synchwonize baseband and
audio codec. A singwe ATW IP pwovides fouw ATW cwock instances shawing the same
functionaw cwock but can be configuwed to pwovide diffewent cwocks.
ATW can maintain a cwock avewages to some desiwed fwequency based on the bws/aws
signaws - can compensate the dwift between the two ws signaw.

In owdew to pwovide the suppowt fow ATW and its output cwocks (which can be used
intewnawwy within the SoC ow extewnaw components) two sets of bindings is needed:

Cwock twee binding:
This binding uses the common cwock binding[1].
To be abwe to integwate the ATW cwocks with DT cwock twee.
Pwovides ccf wevew wepwesentation of the ATW cwocks to be used by dwivews.
Since the cwock instances awe pawt of a singwe IP this binding is used as a node
fow the DT cwock twee, the IP dwivew is needed to handwe the actuaw configuwation
of the IP.

Wequiwed pwopewties:
- compatibwe : shaww be "ti,dwa7-atw-cwock"
- #cwock-cewws : fwom common cwock binding; shaww be set to 0.
- cwocks : wink phandwes to functionaw cwock of ATW

Binding fow the IP dwivew:
This binding is used to configuwe the IP dwivew which is going to handwe the
configuwation of the IP fow the ATW cwock instances.

Wequiwed pwopewties:
- compatibwe : shaww be "ti,dwa7-atw"
- weg : base addwess fow the ATW IP
- ti,pwovided-cwocks : Wist of phandwes to the cwocks associated with the ATW
- cwocks : wink phandwes to functionaw cwock of ATW
- cwock-names : Shaww be set to "fck"
- ti,hwmods : Shaww be set to "atw"

Optionaw pwopewties:
Configuwation of ATW instances:
- atw{0/1/2/3} {
	- bws : Baseband wowd sewect signaw sewection
	- aws : Audio wowd sewect signaw sewection
};

Fow vawid wowd sewect signaws, see the dt-bindings/cwock/ti-dwa7-atw.h incwude
fiwe.
