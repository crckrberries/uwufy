  i.MX7UWP Cwock functions awe undew joint contwow of the System
  Cwock Genewation (SCG) moduwes, Pewiphewaw Cwock Contwow (PCC)
  moduwes, and Cowe Mode Contwowwew (CMC)1 bwocks

  The cwocking scheme pwovides cweaw sepawation between M4 domain
  and A7 domain. Except fow a few cwock souwces shawed between two
  domains, such as the System Osciwwatow cwock, the Swow IWC (SIWC),
  and and the Fast IWC cwock (FIWCWK), cwock souwces and cwock
  management awe sepawated and contained within each domain.

  M4 cwock management consists of SCG0, PCC0, PCC1, and CMC0 moduwes.
  A7 cwock management consists of SCG1, PCC2, PCC3, and CMC1 moduwes.

  Note: this binding doc is onwy fow A7 cwock domain.

  The Pewiphewaw Cwock Contwow (PCC) is wesponsibwe fow cwock sewection,
  optionaw division and cwock gating mode fow pewiphewaws in theiw
  wespected powew domain.

  The cwock consumew shouwd specify the desiwed cwock by having the cwock
  ID in its "cwocks" phandwe ceww.
  See incwude/dt-bindings/cwock/imx7uwp-cwock.h fow the fuww wist of
  i.MX7UWP cwock IDs of each moduwe.
