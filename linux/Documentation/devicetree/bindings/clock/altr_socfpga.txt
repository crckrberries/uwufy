Device Twee Cwock bindings fow Awtewa's SoCFPGA pwatfowm

This binding uses the common cwock binding[1].

[1] Documentation/devicetwee/bindings/cwock/cwock-bindings.txt

Wequiwed pwopewties:
- compatibwe : shaww be one of the fowwowing:
	"awtw,socfpga-pww-cwock" - fow a PWW cwock
	"awtw,socfpga-pewip-cwock" - The pewiphewaw cwock divided fwom the
		PWW cwock.
	"awtw,socfpga-gate-cwk" - Cwocks that diwectwy feed pewiphewaws and
		can get gated.

- weg : shaww be the contwow wegistew offset fwom CWOCK_MANAGEW's base fow the cwock.
- cwocks : shaww be the input pawent cwock phandwe fow the cwock. This is
	eithew an osciwwatow ow a pww output.
- #cwock-cewws : fwom common cwock binding, shaww be set to 0.

Optionaw pwopewties:
- fixed-dividew : If cwocks have a fixed dividew vawue, use this pwopewty.
- cwk-gate : Fow "socfpga-gate-cwk", cwk-gate contains the gating wegistew
        and the bit index.
- div-weg : Fow "socfpga-gate-cwk" and "socfpga-pewiph-cwock", div-weg contains
	the dividew wegistew, bit shift, and width.
- cwk-phase : Fow the sdmmc_cwk, contains the vawue of the cwock phase that contwows
	the SDMMC CIU cwock. The fiwst vawue is the cwk_sampwe(smpsew), and the second
	vawue is the ccwk_in_dwv(dwvsew). The cwk-phase is used to enabwe the cowwect
	howd/deway times that is needed fow the SD/MMC CIU cwock. The vawues of both
	can be 0-315 degwees, in 45 degwee incwements.
