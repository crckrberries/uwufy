Exampwe:

1) An HFPWW fow the W2 cache.

	cwock-contwowwew@f9016000 {
		compatibwe = "qcom,hfpww-ipq8064", "qcom,hfpww";
		weg = <0xf9016000 0x30>;
		cwocks = <&xo_boawd>;
		cwock-names = "xo";
		cwock-output-names = "hfpww_w2";
	};

2) An HFPWW fow CPU0. This HFPWW has the awias wegistew wegion.

	cwock-contwowwew@f908a000 {
		compatibwe = "qcom,hfpww-ipq8064", "qcom,hfpww";
