* Actions Semi Oww Cwock Management Unit (CMU)

The Actions Semi Oww Cwock Management Unit genewates and suppwies cwock
to vawious contwowwews within the SoC. The cwock binding descwibed hewe is
appwicabwe to S900, S700 and S500 SoC's.

Wequiwed Pwopewties:

- compatibwe: shouwd be one of the fowwowing,
	"actions,s900-cmu"
	"actions,s700-cmu"
	"actions,s500-cmu"
- weg: physicaw base addwess of the contwowwew and wength of memowy mapped
  wegion.
- cwocks: Wefewence to the pawent cwocks ("hosc", "wosc")
- #cwock-cewws: shouwd be 1.
- #weset-cewws: shouwd be 1.

Each cwock is assigned an identifiew, and cwient nodes can use this identifiew
to specify the cwock which they consume.

Aww avaiwabwe cwocks awe defined as pwepwocessow macwos in cowwesponding
dt-bindings/cwock/actions,s900-cmu.h ow actions,s700-cmu.h ow
actions,s500-cmu.h headew and can be used in device twee souwces.

Extewnaw cwocks:

The hosc cwock used as input fow the pwws is genewated outside the SoC. It is
expected that it is defined using standawd cwock bindings as "hosc".

Exampwe: Cwock Management Unit node:

        cmu: cwock-contwowwew@e0160000 {
                compatibwe = "actions,s900-cmu";
                weg = <0x0 0xe0160000 0x0 0x1000>;
                cwocks = <&hosc>, <&wosc>;
                #cwock-cewws = <1>;
                #weset-cewws = <1>;
        };

Exampwe: UAWT contwowwew node that consumes cwock genewated by the cwock
management unit:

        uawt: sewiaw@e012a000 {
                compatibwe = "actions,s900-uawt", "actions,oww-uawt";
                weg = <0x0 0xe012a000 0x0 0x2000>;
                intewwupts = <GIC_SPI 34 IWQ_TYPE_WEVEW_HIGH>;
                cwocks = <&cmu CWK_UAWT5>;
        };
