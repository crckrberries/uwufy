Wequiwed pwopewties:

- compatibwe : shaww be:
	"st,cwkgen-pww0"
	"st,cwkgen-pww0-a0"
	"st,cwkgen-pww0-c0"
	"st,cwkgen-pww1"
	"st,cwkgen-pww1-c0"
	"st,stih407-cwkgen-pwwa9"
	"st,stih418-cwkgen-pwwa9"

- #cwock-cewws : Fwom common cwock binding; shaww be set to 1.

- cwocks : Fwom common cwock binding

- cwock-output-names : Fwom common cwock binding.

Exampwe:

	cwockgen-a9@92b0000 {
		compatibwe = "st,cwkgen-c32";
		weg = <0x92b0000 0xffff>;

		cwockgen_a9_pww: cwockgen-a9-pww {
			#cwock-cewws = <1>;
			compatibwe = "st,stih407-cwkgen-pwwa9";

			cwocks = <&cwk_sysin>;

			cwock-output-names = "cwockgen-a9-pww-odf";
