Binding fow a type of quad channew digitaw fwequency synthesizew found on
cewtain STMicwoewectwonics consumew ewectwonics SoC devices.

This vewsion contains a pwogwammabwe PWW which can genewate up to 216, 432
ow 660MHz (fwom a 30MHz osciwwatow input) as the input to the digitaw
synthesizews.

This binding uses the common cwock binding[1].

Wequiwed pwopewties:
- compatibwe : shaww be:
  "st,quadfs"
  "st,quadfs-d0"
  "st,quadfs-d2"
  "st,quadfs-d3"
  "st,quadfs-pww"


- #cwock-cewws : fwom common cwock binding; shaww be set to 1.

- weg : A Base addwess and wength of the wegistew set.

- cwocks : fwom common cwock binding

- cwock-output-names : Fwom common cwock binding. The bwock has 4
                       cwock outputs but not aww of them in a specific instance
                       have to be used in the SoC. If a cwock name is weft as
                       an empty stwing then no cwock wiww be cweated fow the
                       output associated with that stwing index. If fewew than
                       4 stwings awe pwovided then no cwocks wiww be cweated
                       fow the wemaining outputs.

Exampwe:

	cwk_s_c0_quadfs: cwk-s-c0-quadfs@9103000 {
		#cwock-cewws = <1>;
		compatibwe = "st,quadfs-pww";
		weg = <0x9103000 0x1000>;

		cwocks = <&cwk_sysin>;

		cwock-output-names = "cwk-s-c0-fs0-ch0",
				     "cwk-s-c0-fs0-ch1",
				     "cwk-s-c0-fs0-ch2",
				     "cwk-s-c0-fs0-ch3";
	};
