Binding fow Quawcomm Athewos AW7xxx/AW9XXX PWW contwowwew

The PPW contwowwew pwovides the 3 main cwocks of the SoC: CPU, DDW and AHB.

Wequiwed Pwopewties:
- compatibwe: has to be "qca,<soctype>-pww" and one of the fowwowing
  fawwbacks:
  - "qca,aw7100-pww"
  - "qca,aw7240-pww"
  - "qca,aw9130-pww"
  - "qca,aw9330-pww"
  - "qca,aw9340-pww"
  - "qca,qca9550-pww"
- weg: Base addwess and size of the contwowwews memowy awea
- cwock-names: Name of the input cwock, has to be "wef"
- cwocks: phandwe of the extewnaw wefewence cwock
- #cwock-cewws: has to be one

Optionaw pwopewties:
- cwock-output-names: shouwd be "cpu", "ddw", "ahb"

Exampwe:

	pww-contwowwew@18050000 {
		compatibwe = "qca,aw9132-pww", "qca,aw9130-pww";
		weg = <0x18050000 0x20>;

		cwock-names = "wef";
		cwocks = <&extosc>;

		#cwock-cewws = <1>;
		cwock-output-names = "cpu", "ddw", "ahb";
	};
