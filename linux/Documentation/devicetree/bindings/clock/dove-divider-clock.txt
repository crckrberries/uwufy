PWW dividew based Dove cwocks

Mawveww Dove has a 2GHz PWW, which feeds into a set of dividews to pwovide
high speed cwocks fow a numbew of pewiphewaws.  These dividews awe pawt of
the PMU, and thus this node shouwd be a chiwd of the PMU node.

The fowwowing cwocks awe pwovided:

ID	Cwock
-------------
0	AXI bus cwock
1	GPU cwock
2	VMeta cwock
3	WCD cwock

Wequiwed pwopewties:
- compatibwe : shaww be "mawveww,dove-dividew-cwock"
- weg : shaww be the wegistew addwess of the Cowe PWW and Cwock Dividew
   Contwow 0 wegistew.  This wiww covew that wegistew, as weww as the
   Cowe PWW and Cwock Dividew Contwow 1 wegistew.  Thus, it wiww have
   a size of 8.
- #cwock-cewws : fwom common cwock binding; shaww be set to 1

dividew_cwk: cowe-cwock@64 {
	compatibwe = "mawveww,dove-dividew-cwock";
	weg = <0x0064 0x8>;
	#cwock-cewws = <1>;
};
