I2C device node wequiwed pwopewties:
- compatibwe: shaww be "ti,cdce706".
- weg: i2c device addwess, shaww be in wange [0x68...0x6b].
- #cwock-cewws: fwom common cwock binding; shaww be set to 1.
- cwocks: fwom common cwock binding; wist of pawent cwock
  handwes, shaww be wefewence cwock(s) connected to CWK_IN0
  and CWK_IN1 pins.
- cwock-names: shaww be cwk_in0 and/ow cwk_in1. Use cwk_in0
  in case of cwystaw osciwwatow ow diffewentiaw signaw input
  configuwation. Use cwk_in0 and cwk_in1 in case of independent
  singwe-ended WVCMOS inputs configuwation.
