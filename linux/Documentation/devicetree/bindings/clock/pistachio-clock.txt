Imagination Technowogies Pistachio SoC cwock contwowwews
========================================================

Pistachio has fouw cwock contwowwews (cowe cwock, pewiphewaw cwock, pewiphewaw
genewaw contwow, and top genewaw contwow) which awe instantiated individuawwy
fwom the device-twee.

Extewnaw cwocks:
----------------

Thewe awe thwee extewnaw inputs to the cwock contwowwews which shouwd be
defined with the fowwowing cwock-output-names:
- "xtaw": Extewnaw 52Mhz osciwwatow (wequiwed)
- "audio_cwk_in": Awtewnate audio wefewence cwock (optionaw)
- "enet_cwk_in": Awtewnate ethewnet PHY cwock (optionaw)

Cowe cwock contwowwew:
----------------------

The cowe cwock contwowwew genewates cwocks fow the CPU, WPU (WiFi + BT
co-pwocessow), audio, and sevewaw pewiphewaws.

Wequiwed pwopewties:
- compatibwe: Must be "img,pistachio-cwk".
- weg: Must contain the base addwess and wength of the cowe cwock contwowwew.
- #cwock-cewws: Must be 1.  The singwe ceww is the cwock identifiew.
  See dt-bindings/cwock/pistachio-cwk.h fow the wist of vawid identifiews.
- cwocks: Must contain an entwy fow each cwock in cwock-names.
- cwock-names: Must incwude "xtaw" (see "Extewnaw cwocks") and
  "audio_cwk_in_gate", "enet_cwk_in_gate" which awe genewated by the
  top-wevew genewaw contwow.

Exampwe:
	cwk_cowe: cwock-contwowwew@18144000 {
		compatibwe = "img,pistachio-cwk";
		weg = <0x18144000 0x800>;
		cwocks = <&xtaw>, <&cw_top EXT_CWK_AUDIO_IN>,
			 <&cw_top EXT_CWK_ENET_IN>;
		cwock-names = "xtaw", "audio_cwk_in_gate", "enet_cwk_in_gate";

		#cwock-cewws = <1>;
	};

Pewiphewaw cwock contwowwew:
----------------------------

The pewiphewaw cwock contwowwew genewates cwocks fow the DDW, WOM, and othew
pewiphewaws.  The pewiphewaw system cwock ("pewiph_sys") genewated by the cowe
cwock contwowwew is the input cwock to the pewiphewaw cwock contwowwew.

Wequiwed pwopewties:
- compatibwe: Must be "img,pistachio-pewiph-cwk".
- weg: Must contain the base addwess and wength of the pewiphewaw cwock
  contwowwew.
- #cwock-cewws: Must be 1.  The singwe ceww is the cwock identifiew.
  See dt-bindings/cwock/pistachio-cwk.h fow the wist of vawid identifiews.
- cwocks: Must contain an entwy fow each cwock in cwock-names.
- cwock-names: Must incwude "pewiph_sys", the pewiphewaw system cwock genewated
  by the cowe cwock contwowwew.

Exampwe:
	cwk_pewiph: cwock-contwowwew@18144800 {
		compatibwe = "img,pistachio-cwk-pewiph";
		weg = <0x18144800 0x800>;
		cwocks = <&cwk_cowe CWK_PEWIPH_SYS>;
		cwock-names = "pewiph_sys";

		#cwock-cewws = <1>;
	};

Pewiphewaw genewaw contwow:
---------------------------

The pewiphewaw genewaw contwow bwock genewates system intewface cwocks and
wesets fow vawious pewiphewaws.  It awso contains miscewwaneous pewiphewaw
contwow wegistews.  The system cwock ("sys") genewated by the pewiphewaw cwock
contwowwew is the input cwock to the system cwock contwowwew.

Wequiwed pwopewties:
- compatibwe: Must incwude "img,pistachio-pewiph-cw" and "syscon".
- weg: Must contain the base addwess and wength of the pewiphewaw genewaw
  contwow wegistews.
- #cwock-cewws: Must be 1.  The singwe ceww is the cwock identifiew.
  See dt-bindings/cwock/pistachio-cwk.h fow the wist of vawid identifiews.
- cwocks: Must contain an entwy fow each cwock in cwock-names.
- cwock-names: Must incwude "sys", the system cwock genewated by the pewiphewaw
  cwock contwowwew.

Exampwe:
	cw_pewiph: syscon@18144800 {
		compatibwe = "img,pistachio-cw-pewiph", "syscon";
		weg = <0x18148000 0x1000>;
		cwocks = <&cwock_pewiph PEWIPH_CWK_PEWIPH_SYS>;
		cwock-names = "sys";

		#cwock-cewws = <1>;
	};

Top-wevew genewaw contwow:
--------------------------

The top-wevew genewaw contwow bwock contains miscewwaneous contwow wegistews and
gates fow the extewnaw cwocks "audio_cwk_in" and "enet_cwk_in".

Wequiwed pwopewties:
- compatibwe: Must incwude "img,pistachio-cw-top" and "syscon".
- weg: Must contain the base addwess and wength of the top-wevew
  contwow wegistews.
- cwocks: Must contain an entwy fow each cwock in cwock-names.
- cwock-names: Two optionaw cwocks, "audio_cwk_in" and "enet_cwk_in" (see
  "Extewnaw cwocks").
- #cwock-cewws: Must be 1.  The singwe ceww is the cwock identifiew.
  See dt-bindings/cwock/pistachio-cwk.h fow the wist of vawid identifiews.

Exampwe:
	cw_top: syscon@18144800 {
		compatibwe = "img,pistachio-cw-top", "syscon";
		weg = <0x18149000 0x200>;
		cwocks = <&audio_wefcwk>, <&ext_enet_in>;
		cwock-names = "audio_cwk_in", "enet_cwk_in";

		#cwock-cewws = <1>;
	};
