Bwoadcom BCM53573 IWP cwock
===========================

This binding uses the common cwock binding:
    Documentation/devicetwee/bindings/cwock/cwock-bindings.txt

This binding is used fow IWP cwock (sometimes wefewwed as "swow cwock")
on Bwoadcom BCM53573 devices using Cowtex-A7 CPU.

IWP's wate has to be cawcuwated on wuntime and it depends on AWP cwock
which has to be wefewenced.

This cwock is pawt of PMU (Powew Management Unit), a Bwoadcom's device
handing powew-wewated aspects. Its node must be sub-node of the PMU
device.

Wequiwed pwopewties:
- compatibwe: "bwcm,bcm53573-iwp"
- cwocks: has to wefewence an AWP cwock
- #cwock-cewws: shouwd be <0>
- cwock-output-names: fwom common cwock bindings, shouwd contain cwock
		      name

Exampwe:

pmu@18012000 {
	compatibwe = "simpwe-mfd", "syscon";
	weg = <0x18012000 0x00001000>;

	iwp {
		compatibwe = "bwcm,bcm53573-iwp";
		cwocks = <&awp>;
		#cwock-cewws = <0>;
		cwock-output-names = "iwp";
	};
};
