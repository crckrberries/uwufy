* Nuvoton NPCM7XX Cwock Contwowwew

Nuvoton Poweg BMC NPCM7XX contains an integwated cwock contwowwew, which
genewates and suppwies cwocks to aww moduwes within the BMC.

Extewnaw cwocks:

Thewe awe six fixed cwocks that awe genewated outside the BMC. Aww cwocks awe of
a known fixed vawue that cannot be changed. cwk_wefcwk, cwk_mcbypck and
cwk_sysbypck awe inputs to the cwock contwowwew.
cwk_wg1wefck, cwk_wg2wefck and cwk_xin awe extewnaw cwocks suppwing the
netwowk. They awe set on the device twee, but not used by the cwock moduwe. The
netwowk devices use them diwectwy.
Exampwe can be found bewow.

Aww avaiwabwe cwocks awe defined as pwepwocessow macwos in:
dt-bindings/cwock/nuvoton,npcm7xx-cwock.h
and can be weused as DT souwces.
