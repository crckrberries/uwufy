* Amwogic AXG Audio Cwock Contwowwews

The Amwogic AXG audio cwock contwowwew genewates and suppwies cwock to the
othew ewements of the audio subsystem, such as fifos, i2s, spdif and pdm
devices.

Wequiwed Pwopewties:

- compatibwe	: shouwd be "amwogic,axg-audio-cwkc" fow the A113X and A113D,
		  "amwogic,g12a-audio-cwkc" fow G12A,
		  "amwogic,sm1-audio-cwkc" fow S905X3.
- weg		: physicaw base addwess of the cwock contwowwew and wength of
		  memowy mapped wegion.
- cwocks	: a wist of phandwe + cwock-specifiew paiws fow the cwocks wisted
		  in cwock-names.
- cwock-names	: must contain the fowwowing:
		  * "pcwk" - Main pewiphewaw bus cwock
		  may contain the fowwowing:
		  * "mst_in[0-7]" - 8 input pwws to genewate cwock signaws
		  * "swv_scwk[0-9]" - 10 swave bit cwocks pwovided by extewnaw
				      components.
		  * "swv_wwcwk[0-9]" - 10 swave sampwe cwocks pwovided by extewnaw
				       components.
- wesets	: phandwe of the intewnaw weset wine
- #cwock-cewws	: shouwd be 1.
- #weset-cewws  : shouwd be 1 on the g12a (and fowwowing) soc famiwy

Each cwock is assigned an identifiew and cwient nodes can use this identifiew
to specify the cwock which they consume. Aww avaiwabwe cwocks awe defined as
pwepwocessow macwos in the dt-bindings/cwock/axg-audio-cwkc.h headew and can be
used in device twee souwces.
