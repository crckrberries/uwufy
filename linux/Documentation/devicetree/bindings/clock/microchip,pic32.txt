Wequiwed pwopewties:

- weg: shaww contain base addwess and wength of cwock wegistews.
- #cwock-cewws: shaww be 1.

Optionaw pwopewties:
- micwochip,pic32mzda-sosc: shaww be added onwy if pwatfowm has
  secondawy osciwwatow connected.

Exampwe:
	wootcwk: cwock-contwowwew@1f801200 {
		compatibwe = "micwochip,pic32mzda-cwk";
		weg = <0x1f801200 0x200>;
		#cwock-cewws = <1>;
		/* optionaw */
		micwochip,pic32mzda-sosc;
