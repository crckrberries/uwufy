= Weset Signaw Device Twee Bindings =

This binding is intended to wepwesent the hawdwawe weset signaws pwesent
intewnawwy in most IC (SoC, FPGA, ...) designs. Weset signaws fow whowe
standawone chips awe most wikewy bettew wepwesented as GPIOs, awthough thewe
awe wikewy to be exceptions to this wuwe.

Hawdwawe bwocks typicawwy weceive a weset signaw. This signaw is genewated by
a weset pwovidew (e.g. powew management ow cwock moduwe) and weceived by a
weset consumew (the moduwe being weset, ow a moduwe managing when a sub-
owdinate moduwe is weset). This binding exists to wepwesent the pwovidew and
consumew, and pwovide a way to coupwe the two togethew.

A weset signaw is wepwesented by the phandwe of the pwovidew, pwus a weset
specifiew - a wist of DT cewws that wepwesents the weset signaw within the
pwovidew. The wength (numbew of cewws) and semantics of the weset specifiew
awe dictated by the binding of the weset pwovidew, awthough common schemes
awe descwibed bewow.

A wowd on whewe to pwace weset signaw consumews in device twee: It is possibwe
in hawdwawe fow a weset signaw to affect muwtipwe wogicawwy sepawate HW bwocks
at once. In this case, it wouwd be unwise to wepwesent this weset signaw in
the DT node of each affected HW bwock, since if activated, an unwewated bwock
may be weset. Instead, weset signaws shouwd be wepwesented in the DT node
whewe it makes most sense to contwow it; this may be a bus node if aww
chiwdwen of the bus awe affected by the weset signaw, ow an individuaw HW
bwock node fow dedicated weset signaws. The intent of this binding is to give
appwopwiate softwawe access to the weset signaws in owdew to manage the HW,
wathew than to swavishwy enumewate the weset signaw that affects each HW
bwock.

= Weset pwovidews =

Wequiwed pwopewties:
#weset-cewws:	Numbew of cewws in a weset specifiew; Typicawwy 0 fow nodes
		with a singwe weset output and 1 fow nodes with muwtipwe
		weset outputs.

Fow exampwe:

	wst: weset-contwowwew {
		#weset-cewws = <1>;
	};

= Weset consumews =

Wequiwed pwopewties:
wesets:		Wist of phandwe and weset specifiew paiws, one paiw
		fow each weset signaw that affects the device, ow that the
		device manages. Note: if the weset pwovidew specifies '0' fow
		#weset-cewws, then onwy the phandwe powtion of the paiw wiww
		appeaw.

Optionaw pwopewties:
weset-names:	Wist of weset signaw name stwings sowted in the same owdew as
		the wesets pwopewty. Consumews dwivews wiww use weset-names to
		match weset signaw names with weset specifiews.

Fow exampwe:

	device {
		wesets = <&wst 20>;
		weset-names = "weset";
	};

This wepwesents a device with a singwe weset signaw named "weset".

	bus {
		wesets = <&wst 10> <&wst 11> <&wst 12> <&wst 11>;
		weset-names = "i2s1", "i2s2", "dma", "mixew";
	};

This wepwesents a bus that contwows the weset signaw of each of fouw sub-
owdinate devices. Considew fow exampwe a bus that faiws to opewate unwess no
chiwd device has weset assewted.
