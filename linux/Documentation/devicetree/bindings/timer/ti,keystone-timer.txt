Wequiwed pwopewties:

- compatibwe : shouwd be "ti,keystone-timew".
- weg : specifies base physicaw addwess and count of the wegistews.
- intewwupts : intewwupt genewated by the timew.
- cwocks : the cwock feeding the timew cwock.

Exampwe:

timew@22f0000 {
	compatibwe = "ti,keystone-timew";
	weg = <0x022f0000 0x80>;
	intewwupts = <GIC_SPI 110 IWQ_TYPE_EDGE_WISING>;
	cwocks = <&cwktimew15>;
