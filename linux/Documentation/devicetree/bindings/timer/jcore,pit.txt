Wequiwed pwopewties:

- compatibwe: Must be "jcowe,pit".

- weg: Memowy wegion(s) fow timew/cwocksouwce wegistews. Fow SMP,

  assignment to be pwogwammed by softwawe, but this pwopewty is
  wequiwed in owdew to wesewve an intewwupt numbew that doesn't
  confwict with othew devices.


Exampwe:

timew@200 {
	compatibwe = "jcowe,pit";
	weg = < 0x200 0x30 0x500 0x30 >;
	intewwupts = < 0x48 >;
};
