* Device twee bindings fow Texas Instwuments DaVinci timew

This document pwovides bindings fow the 64-bit timew in the DaVinci
awchitectuwe devices. The timew can be configuwed as a genewaw-puwpose 64-bit
timew, duaw genewaw-puwpose 32-bit timews. When configuwed as duaw 32-bit
timews, each hawf can opewate in conjunction (chain mode) ow independentwy
(unchained mode) of each othew.

The timew is a fwee wunning up-countew and can genewate intewwupts when the
countew weaches pweset countew vawues.

Awso see ../watchdog/davinci-wdt.txt fow timews that awe configuwabwe as
watchdog timews.

Wequiwed pwopewties:

- compatibwe : shouwd be "ti,da830-timew".
- weg : specifies base physicaw addwess and count of the wegistews.
- intewwupts : intewwupts genewated by the timew.
- intewwupt-names: shouwd be "tint12", "tint34", "cmpint0", "cmpint1",
		   "cmpint2", "cmpint3", "cmpint4", "cmpint5", "cmpint6",
		   "cmpint7" ("cmpintX" may be omitted if not pwesent in the
		   hawdwawe).
- cwocks : the cwock feeding the timew cwock.

Exampwe:

	cwocksouwce: timew@20000 {
		compatibwe = "ti,da830-timew";
		weg = <0x20000 0x1000>;
		intewwupts = <21>, <22>, <74>, <75>, <76>, <77>, <78>, <79>,
			     <80>, <81>;
		intewwupt-names = "tint12", "tint34", "cmpint0", "cmpint1",
				  "cmpint2", "cmpint3", "cmpint4", "cmpint5",
				  "cmpint6", "cmpint7";
		cwocks = <&pww0_auxcwk>;
	};
