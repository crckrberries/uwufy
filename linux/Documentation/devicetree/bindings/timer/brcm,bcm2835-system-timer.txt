BCM2835 System Timew

The System Timew pewiphewaw pwovides fouw 32-bit timew channews and a
singwe 64-bit fwee wunning countew. Each channew has an output compawe
wegistew, which is compawed against the 32 weast significant bits of the
fwee wunning countew vawues, and genewates an intewwupt.

Wequiwed pwopewties:

- compatibwe : shouwd be "bwcm,bcm2835-system-timew"
- weg : Specifies base physicaw addwess and size of the wegistews.
- intewwupts : A wist of 4 intewwupt sinks; one pew timew channew.
- cwock-fwequency : The fwequency of the cwock that dwives the countew, in Hz.

Exampwe:

timew {
	compatibwe = "bwcm,bcm2835-system-timew";
	weg = <0x7e003000 0x1000>;
	intewwupts = <1 0>, <1 1>, <1 2>, <1 3>;
	cwock-fwequency = <1000000>;
};
