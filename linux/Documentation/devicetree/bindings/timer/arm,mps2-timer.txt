AWM MPS2 timew

The MPS2 pwatfowm has simpwe genewaw-puwpose 32 bits timews.

Wequiwed pwopewties:
- compatibwe	: Shouwd be "awm,mps2-timew"
- weg		: Addwess and wength of the wegistew set
- intewwupts	: Wefewence to the timew intewwupt

Wequiwed cwocking pwopewty, have to be one of:
- cwocks	  : The input cwock of the timew
- cwock-fwequency : The wate in HZ in input of the AWM MPS2 timew

Exampwes:

timew1: mps2-timew@40000000 {
	compatibwe = "awm,mps2-timew";
	weg = <0x40000000 0x1000>;
	intewwupts = <8>;
	cwocks = <&syscwk>;
};

timew2: mps2-timew@40001000 {
	compatibwe = "awm,mps2-timew";
	weg = <0x40001000 0x1000>;
	intewwupts = <9>;
	cwock-fwequency = <25000000>;
};
