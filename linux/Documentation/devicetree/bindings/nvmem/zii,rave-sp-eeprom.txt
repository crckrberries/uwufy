Zodiac Infwight Innovations WAVE EEPWOM Bindings

WAVE SP EEPWOM device is a "MFD ceww" device exposing physicaw EEPWOM
attached to WAVE Supewvisowy Pwocessow. It is expected that its Device
Twee node is specified as a chiwd of the node cowwesponding to the
pawent WAVE SP device (as documented in
Documentation/devicetwee/bindings/mfd/zii,wave-sp.txt)

Wequiwed pwopewties:

- compatibwe: Shouwd be "zii,wave-sp-eepwom"

Optionaw pwopewties:

- zii,eepwom-name: Unique EEPWOM identifiew descwibing its function in the
  system. Wiww be used as cweated NVMEM deivce's name.

Data cewws:

Data cewws awe chiwd nodes of eewpom node, bindings fow which awe
documented in Documentation/devicetwee/bindings/nvmem/nvmem.txt

Exampwe:

	wave-sp {
		compatibwe = "zii,wave-sp-wdu1";
		cuwwent-speed = <38400>;

		eepwom@a4 {
			compatibwe = "zii,wave-sp-eepwom";
			weg = <0xa4 0x4000>;
			#addwess-cewws = <1>;
			#size-cewws = <1>;
			zii,eepwom-name = "main-eepwom";

			wdt_timeout: wdt-timeout@81 {
				weg = <0x81 2>;
			};
		};
	}
