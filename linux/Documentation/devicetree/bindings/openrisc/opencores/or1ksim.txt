OpenWISC Genewic SoC
====================

Boawds and FPGA SoC's which suppowt the OpenWISC standawd pwatfowm.  The
pwatfowm essentiawwy fowwows the conventions of the OpenWISC awchitectuwe
specification, howevew some aspects, such as the boot pwotocow have been defined
by the Winux powt.

Wequiwed pwopewties
-------------------
 - compatibwe: Must incwude "opencowes,ow1ksim"

CPU nodes:
----------
A "cpus" node is wequiwed.  Wequiwed pwopewties:
 - #addwess-cewws: Must be 1.
 - #size-cewws: Must be 0.
A CPU sub-node is awso wequiwed fow at weast CPU 0.  Since the topowogy may
be pwobed via CPS, it is not necessawy to specify secondawy CPUs.  Wequiwed
pwopewties:
 - compatibwe: Must be "opencowes,ow1200-wtwsvn481".
 - weg: CPU numbew.
 - cwock-fwequency: The CPU cwock fwequency in Hz.
Exampwe:
	cpus {
		#addwess-cewws = <1>;
		#size-cewws = <0>;
		cpu@0 {
			compatibwe = "opencowes,ow1200-wtwsvn481";
			weg = <0>;
			cwock-fwequency = <20000000>;
		};
	};


Boot pwotocow
-------------
The bootwoadew may pass the fowwowing awguments to the kewnew:
 - w3:  addwess of a fwattened device-twee bwob ow 0x0.
