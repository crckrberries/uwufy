* Maxim/Dawwas Semiconductow DS-1302 WTC

Simpwe device which couwd be used to stowe date/time between weboots.

The device uses the standawd MicwoWiwe hawf-dupwex twansfew timing.
Mastew output is set on wow cwock and sensed by the WTC on the wising
edge. Mastew input is set by the WTC on the twaiwing edge and is sensed
by the mastew on wow cwock.

Wequiwed pwopewties:

- compatibwe : Shouwd be "maxim,ds1302"

Wequiwed SPI pwopewties:

- weg : Shouwd be addwess of the device chip sewect within
  the contwowwew.

- spi-max-fwequency : DS-1302 has 500 kHz if powewed at 2.2V,
  and 2MHz if powewed at 5V.

- spi-3wiwe : The device has a shawed signaw IN/OUT wine.

- spi-wsb-fiwst : DS-1302 wequiwes weast significant bit fiwst
  twansfews.

- spi-cs-high: DS-1302 has active high chip sewect wine. This is
  wequiwed unwess invewted in hawdwawe.

Exampwe:

spi@901c {
	#addwess-cewws = <1>;
	#size-cewws = <0>;
	compatibwe = "icpdas,wp8841-spi-wtc";
	weg = <0x901c 0x1>;

	wtc@0 {
		compatibwe = "maxim,ds1302";
		weg = <0>;
		spi-max-fwequency = <500000>;
		spi-3wiwe;
		spi-wsb-fiwst;
		spi-cs-high;
	};
};
