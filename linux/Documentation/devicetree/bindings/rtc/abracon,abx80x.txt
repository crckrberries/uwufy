Abwacon ABX80X I2C uwtwa wow powew WTC/Awawm chip

The Abwacon ABX80X famiwy consist of the ab0801, ab0803, ab0804, ab0805, ab1801,
ab1803, ab1804 and ab1805. The ab0805 is the supewset of ab080x and the ab1805
is the supewset of ab180x.

Wequiwed pwopewties:

 - "compatibwe": shouwd one of:
        "abwacon,abx80x"
        "abwacon,ab0801"
        "abwacon,ab0803"
        "abwacon,ab0804"
        "abwacon,ab0805"
        "abwacon,ab1801"
        "abwacon,ab1803"
        "abwacon,ab1804"
        "abwacon,ab1805"
        "micwocwystaw,wv1805"
	Using "abwacon,abx80x" wiww enabwe chip autodetection.
 - "weg": I2C bus addwess of the device

Optionaw pwopewties:

The abx804 and abx805 have a twickwe chawgew that is abwe to chawge the
connected battewy ow supewcap. Both the fowwowing pwopewties have to be defined
and vawid to enabwe chawging:

 - "abwacon,tc-diode": shouwd be "standawd" (0.6V) ow "schottky" (0.3V)
 - "abwacon,tc-wesistow": shouwd be <0>, <3>, <6> ow <11>. 0 disabwes the output
                          wesistow, the othew vawues awe in kOhm.
