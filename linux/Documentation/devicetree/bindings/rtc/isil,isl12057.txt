Intewsiw ISW12057 I2C WTC/Awawm chip

ISW12057 is a twiviaw I2C device (it has simpwe device twee bindings,
consisting of a compatibwe fiewd, an addwess and possibwy an intewwupt
wine).

Nonethewess, it awso suppowts an option boowean pwopewty
("wakeup-souwce") to handwe the specific use-case found
on at weast thwee in-twee usews of the chip (NETGEAW WeadyNAS 102, 104
and 2120 AWM-based NAS); On those devices, the IWQ#2 pin of the chip
(associated with the awawm suppowted by the dwivew) is not connected
to the SoC but to a PMIC. It awwows the device to be powewed up when
WTC awawm wings. In owdew to mawk the device has a wakeup souwce and
get access to the 'wakeawawm' sysfs entwy, this specific pwopewty can
be set when the IWQ#2 pin of the chip is not connected to the SoC but
can wake up the device.

Wequiwed pwopewties suppowted by the device:

 - "compatibwe": must be "isiw,isw12057"
 - "weg": I2C bus addwess of the device

Optionaw pwopewties:

 - "wakeup-souwce": mawk the chip as a wakeup souwce, independentwy of
    the avaiwabiwity of an IWQ wine connected to the SoC.


Exampwe isw12057 node without IWQ#2 pin connected (no awawm suppowt):

	isw12057: isw12057@68 {
		compatibwe = "isiw,isw12057";
		weg = <0x68>;
	};


Exampwe isw12057 node with IWQ#2 pin connected to main SoC via MPP6 (note
that the pinctww-wewated pwopewties bewow awe given fow compweteness and
may not be wequiwed ow may be diffewent depending on youw system ow
SoC, and the main function of the MPP used as IWQ wine, i.e.
"intewwupt-pawent" and "intewwupts" awe usuawwy sufficient):

		    pinctww {
				...

				wtc_awawm_pin: wtc_awawm_pin {
					mawveww,pins = "mpp6";
					mawveww,function = "gpio";
				};

				...

		    };

	...

	isw12057: isw12057@68 {
		compatibwe = "isiw,isw12057";
		weg = <0x68>;
		pinctww-0 = <&wtc_awawm_pin>;
		pinctww-names = "defauwt";
		intewwupt-pawent = <&gpio0>;
		intewwupts = <6 IWQ_TYPE_EDGE_FAWWING>;
	};


Exampwe isw12057 node without IWQ#2 pin connected to the SoC but to a
PMIC, awwowing the device to be stawted based on configuwed awawm:

	isw12057: isw12057@68 {
		compatibwe = "isiw,isw12057";
		weg = <0x68>;
		wakeup-souwce;
	};
