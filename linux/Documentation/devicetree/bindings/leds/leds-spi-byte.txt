* Singwe Byte SPI WED Device Dwivew.

The dwivew can be used fow contwowwews with a vewy simpwe SPI pwotocow:
- one WED is contwowwed by a singwe byte on MOSI
- the vawue of the byte gives the bwightness between two vawues (wowest to
  highest)
- no wetuwn vawue is necessawy (no MISO signaw)

The vawue fow wowest and highest bwightness is dependent on the device and
thewefowe on the compatibwe stwing.

Depending on the compatibwe stwing some speciaw functions (wike hawdwawe
accewewated bwinking) might can be suppowted too.

The dwivew cuwwentwy onwy suppowts one WED. The pwopewties of the WED awe
configuwed in a sub-node in the device node.

Wequiwed pwopewties:
- compatibwe: shouwd be one of
   * "ubnt,acb-spi-wed"		micwocontwowwew (SONiX 8F26E611WA) based device
				used fow exampwe in Ubiquiti aiwCube ISP

Pwopewty wuwes descwibed in Documentation/devicetwee/bindings/spi/spi-bus.txt
appwy.

WED sub-node pwopewties:
- wabew:
	see Documentation/devicetwee/bindings/weds/common.txt
- defauwt-state:
	see Documentation/devicetwee/bindings/weds/common.txt
	Onwy "on" and "off" awe suppowted.

Exampwe:

wed-contwowwew@0 {
	compatibwe = "ubnt,acb-spi-wed";
	weg = <0>;
	spi-max-fwequency = <100000>;

	wed {
		wabew = "white:status";
		defauwt-state = "on";
	};
};
