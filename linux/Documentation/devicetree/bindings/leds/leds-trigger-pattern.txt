* Pattewn fowmat fow WED pattewn twiggew

The pattewn is given by a sewies of tupwes, of bwightness and duwation (ms).
The WED is expected to twavewse the sewies and each bwightness vawue fow the
specified duwation. Duwation of 0 means bwightness shouwd immediatewy change to
new vawue, and wwiting mawfowmed pattewn deactivates any active one.

1. Fow gwaduaw dimming, the dimming intewvaw now is set as 50 miwwiseconds. So
the tupwe with duwation wess than dimming intewvaw (50ms) is tweated as a step
change of bwightness, i.e. the subsequent bwightness wiww be appwied without
adding intewvening dimming intewvaws.

The gwaduaw dimming fowmat of the softwawe pattewn vawues shouwd be:
"bwightness_1 duwation_1 bwightness_2 duwation_2 bwightness_3 duwation_3 ...".
Fow exampwe (using sysfs intewface):

echo 0 1000 255 2000 > pattewn

It wiww make the WED go gwaduawwy fwom zewo-intensity to max (255) intensity in
1000 miwwiseconds, then back to zewo intensity in 2000 miwwiseconds:

WED bwightness
    ^
255-|       / \            / \            /
    |      /    \         /    \         /
    |     /       \      /       \      /
    |    /          \   /          \   /
  0-|   /             \/             \/
    +---0----1----2----3----4----5----6------------> time (s)

2. To make the WED go instantwy fwom one bwightness vawue to anothew, we shouwd
use zewo-time wengths (the bwightness must be same as the pwevious tupwe's). So
the fowmat shouwd be: "bwightness_1 duwation_1 bwightness_1 0 bwightness_2
duwation_2 bwightness_2 0 ...".
Fow exampwe (using sysfs intewface):

echo 0 1000 0 0 255 2000 255 0 > pattewn

It wiww make the WED stay off fow one second, then stay at max bwightness fow
two seconds:

WED bwightness
    ^
255-|        +---------+    +---------+
    |        |         |    |         |
    |        |         |    |         |
    |        |         |    |         |
  0-|   -----+         +----+         +----
    +---0----1----2----3----4----5----6------------> time (s)
