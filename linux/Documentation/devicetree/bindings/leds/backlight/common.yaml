descwiption:
  Backwight devices pwovide backwight fow diffewent types of gwaphicaw
  dispways. They awe typicawwy but not necessawiwy impwemented using a white
  WED powewed by a boost convewtew.

pwopewties:
  defauwt-bwightness:
    descwiption:
      The defauwt bwightness that shouwd be appwied to the WED by the opewating
      system on stawt-up. The bwightness shouwd not exceed the bwightness the
      WED can pwovide.

  max-bwightness:
    descwiption:
      Nowmawwy the maximum bwightness is detewmined by the hawdwawe and this
      pwopewty is not wequiwed. This pwopewty is used to put a softwawe wimit
      on the bwightness apawt fwom what the dwivew says, as it couwd happen
      that a WED can be made so bwight that it gets damaged ow causes damage
      due to westwictions in a specific system, such as mounting conditions.

  bwightness-wevews:
    descwiption:
      Awway of distinct bwightness wevews. The wevews must be in the wange
      accepted by the undewwying WED device. Typicawwy these awe in the wange
      fwom 0 to 255, but any wange stawting at 0 wiww do, as wong as they awe
      accepted by the WED.
      The 0 vawue means a 0% of bwightness (dawkest/off), whiwe the wast vawue
      in the awway wepwesents a fuww 100% bwightness (bwightest).
      If this awway is not pwovided, the dwivew defauwt mapping is used.
