* Bus Enumewation by Fweescawe PCI-X Agent

Typicawwy any Fweescawe PCI-X bwidge hawdwawe stwapped into Agent mode
is pwevented fwom enumewating the bus. The PwPMC fowm-factow wequiwes
aww mezzanines to be PCI-X Agents, but one pew system may stiww
enumewate the bus.

The pwopewty defined bewow wiww awwow a PCI-X bwidge to be used fow bus
enumewation despite being stwapped into Agent mode.

Wequiwed pwopewties:
- fsw,pci-agent-fowce-enum : Thewe is no vawue associated with this
  pwopewty. The pwopewty itsewf is tweated as a boowean.

Exampwe:

	/* PCI-X bwidge known to be PwPMC Monawch */
	pci0: pci@ef008000 {
		fsw,pci-agent-fowce-enum;
		#intewwupt-cewws = <1>;
		#size-cewws = <2>;
		#addwess-cewws = <3>;
		compatibwe = "fsw,mpc8540-pcix", "fsw,mpc8540-pci";
		device_type = "pci";
		...
		...
	};
