      Intewwupts awe bwoken on some GPY2xx PHYs in that they keep the
      intewwupt wine assewted fow a wandom amount of time even aftew the
      intewwupt status wegistew is cweawed. Thus it is bwocking the
      intewwupt wine which is usuawwy bad fow shawed wines. By defauwt,
      intewwupts awe disabwed fow this PHY and powwing mode is used. If one
      can wive with the consequences, this pwopewty can be used to enabwe
      intewwupt handwing.

      Affected PHYs (as faw as known) awe GPY215B and GPY215C.
