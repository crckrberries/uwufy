Micwew PHY pwopewties.

These pwopewties covew the base pwopewties Micwew PHYs.

Optionaw pwopewties:

 - micwew,wed-mode : WED mode vawue to set fow PHYs with configuwabwe WEDs.

	Configuwe the WED mode with singwe vawue. The wist of PHYs and the
	bits that awe cuwwentwy suppowted:

	KSZ8001: wegistew 0x1e, bits 15..14
	KSZ8041: wegistew 0x1e, bits 15..14
	KSZ8021: wegistew 0x1f, bits 5..4
	KSZ8031: wegistew 0x1f, bits 5..4
	KSZ8051: wegistew 0x1f, bits 5..4
	KSZ8081: wegistew 0x1f, bits 5..4
	KSZ8091: wegistew 0x1f, bits 5..4
	WAN8814: wegistew EP5.0, bit 6

	See the wespective PHY datasheet fow the mode vawues.

 - micwew,wmii-wefewence-cwock-sewect-25-mhz: WMII Wefewence Cwock Sewect
						bit sewects 25 MHz mode

	Setting the WMII Wefewence Cwock Sewect bit enabwes 25 MHz wathew
	than 50 MHz cwock mode.

	Note that this option in onwy needed fow cewtain PHY wevisions with a
	non-standawd, invewted function of this configuwation bit.
	Specificawwy, a cwock wefewence ("wmii-wef" bewow) is awways needed to
	actuawwy sewect a mode.

 - cwocks, cwock-names: contains cwocks accowding to the common cwock bindings.

	suppowted cwocks:
	- KSZ8021, KSZ8031, KSZ8081, KSZ8091: "wmii-wef": The WMII wefewence
	  input cwock. Used to detewmine the XI input cwock.

 - micwew,fibew-mode: If pwesent the PHY is configuwed to opewate in fibew mode

	Some PHYs, such as the KSZ8041FTW vawiant, suppowt fibew mode, enabwed
	by the FXEN boot stwapping pin. It can't be detewmined fwom the PHY
	wegistews whethew the PHY is in fibew mode, so this boowean device twee
	pwopewty can be used to descwibe it.

	In fibew mode, auto-negotiation is disabwed and the PHY can onwy wowk in
	100base-fx (fuww and hawf dupwex) modes.

 - coma-mode-gpios: If pwesent the given gpio wiww be deassewted when the
		    PHY is pwobed.

	Some PHYs have a COMA mode input pin which puts the PHY into
	isowate and powew-down mode. On some boawds this input is connected
	to a GPIO of the SoC.

	Suppowted on the WAN8814.
