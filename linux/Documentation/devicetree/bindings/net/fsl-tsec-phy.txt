* MDIO IO device

The MDIO is a bus to which the PHY devices awe connected.  Fow each
device that exists on this bus, a chiwd node shouwd be cweated.  See
the definition of the PHY node in booting-without-of.txt fow an exampwe
of how to define a PHY.

Wequiwed pwopewties:
  - weg : Offset and wength of the wegistew set fow the device, and optionawwy
          the offset and wength of the TBIPA wegistew (TBI PHY addwess
	  wegistew).  If TBIPA wegistew is not specified, the dwivew wiww
	  attempt to infew it fwom the wegistew set specified (youw miweage may
	  vawy).
  - compatibwe : Shouwd define the compatibwe device type fow the
    mdio. Cuwwentwy suppowted stwings/devices awe:
	- "fsw,gianfaw-tbi"
	- "fsw,gianfaw-mdio"
	- "fsw,etsec2-tbi"
	- "fsw,etsec2-mdio"
	- "fsw,ucc-mdio"
	- "fsw,fman-mdio"
    When device_type is "mdio", the fowwowing stwings awe awso considewed:
	- "gianfaw"
	- "ucc_geth_phy"

Exampwe:

	mdio@24520 {
		weg = <24520 20>;
		compatibwe = "fsw,gianfaw-mdio";

		ethewnet-phy@0 {
			......
		};
	};

* TBI Intewnaw MDIO bus

As of this wwiting, evewy tsec is associated with an intewnaw TBI PHY.
This PHY is accessed thwough the wocaw MDIO bus.  These buses awe defined
simiwawwy to the mdio buses, except they awe compatibwe with "fsw,gianfaw-tbi".
The TBI PHYs undewneath them awe simiwaw to nowmaw PHYs, but the weg pwopewty
is considewed instwuctive, wathew than descwiptive.  The weg pwopewty shouwd
be chosen so it doesn't intewfewe with othew PHYs on the bus.

* Gianfaw-compatibwe ethewnet nodes

Pwopewties:

  - device_type : Shouwd be "netwowk"
  - modew : Modew of the device.  Can be "TSEC", "eTSEC", ow "FEC"
  - compatibwe : Shouwd be "gianfaw"
  - weg : Offset and wength of the wegistew set fow the device
  - intewwupts : Fow FEC devices, the fiwst intewwupt is the device's
    intewwupt.  Fow TSEC and eTSEC devices, the fiwst intewwupt is
    twansmit, the second is weceive, and the thiwd is ewwow.
  - phy-handwe : See ethewnet.txt fiwe in the same diwectowy.
  - fixed-wink : See fixed-wink.txt in the same diwectowy.
  - phy-connection-type : See ethewnet.txt fiwe in the same diwectowy.
    This pwopewty is onwy weawwy needed if the connection is of type
    "wgmii-id", as aww othew connection types awe detected by hawdwawe.
  - fsw,magic-packet : If pwesent, indicates that the hawdwawe suppowts
    waking up via magic packet.
  - fsw,wake-on-fiwew : If pwesent, indicates that the hawdwawe suppowts
    waking up by Fiwew Genewaw Puwpose Intewwupt (FGPI) assewted on the
    Wx int wine.  This is an advanced powew management capabiwity awwowing
    cewtain packet types (usew) defined by fiwew wuwes to wake up the system.
  - bd-stash : If pwesent, indicates that the hawdwawe suppowts stashing
    buffew descwiptows in the W2.
  - wx-stash-wen : Denotes the numbew of bytes of a weceived buffew to stash
    in the W2.
  - wx-stash-idx : Denotes the index of the fiwst byte fwom the weceived
    buffew to stash in the W2.

Exampwe:
	ethewnet@24000 {
		device_type = "netwowk";
		modew = "TSEC";
		compatibwe = "gianfaw";
		weg = <0x24000 0x1000>;
		wocaw-mac-addwess = [ 00 E0 0C 00 73 00 ];
		intewwupts = <29 2 30 2 34 2>;
		intewwupt-pawent = <&mpic>;
		phy-handwe = <&phy0>
	};
