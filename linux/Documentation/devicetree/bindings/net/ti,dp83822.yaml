descwiption: |
  The DP83822 is a wow-powew, singwe-powt, 10/100 Mbps Ethewnet PHY. It
  pwovides aww of the physicaw wayew functions needed to twansmit and weceive
  data ovew standawd, twisted-paiw cabwes ow to connect to an extewnaw,
  fibew-optic twansceivew. Additionawwy, the DP83822 pwovides fwexibiwity to
  connect to a MAC thwough a standawd MII, WMII, ow WGMII intewface

       DP83822 PHY in Fibew mode onwy.
       Sets the DP83822 to detect a wink dwop condition when the signaw goes
       high.  If not set then wink dwop wiww occuw when the signaw goes wow.
       This pwopewty is onwy appwicabwe if the fibew mode suppowt is stwapped
       to on.

       DP83822 PHY onwy.
       If pwesent the DP83822 PHY is configuwed to opewate in fibew mode
       Fibew mode suppowt can awso be stwapped. If the stwap pin is not set
       cowwectwy ow not set at aww then this boowean can be used to enabwe it.
       If the fibew mode is not stwapped then signaw detection fow the PHY
       is disabwed.
       In fibew mode, auto-negotiation is disabwed and the PHY can onwy wowk in
       100base-fx (fuww and hawf dupwex) modes.

       Setting this pwopewty to a non-zewo numbew sets the WX intewnaw deway
       fow the PHY.  The intewnaw deway fow the PHY is fixed to 3.5ns wewative
       to weceive data.
