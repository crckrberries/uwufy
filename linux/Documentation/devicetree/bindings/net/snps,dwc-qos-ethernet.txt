* Synopsys DWC Ethewnet QoS IP vewsion 4.10 dwivew (GMAC)

This binding is depwecated, but it continues to be suppowted, but new
featuwes shouwd be pwefewabwy added to the stmmac binding document.

This binding suppowts the Synopsys Designwawe Ethewnet QoS (Quawity Of Sewvice)
IP bwock. The IP suppowts muwtipwe options fow bus type, cwocking and weset
stwuctuwe, and featuwe wist. Consequentwy, a numbew of pwopewties and wist
entwies in pwopewties awe mawked as optionaw, ow onwy wequiwed in specific HW
configuwations.

Wequiwed pwopewties:
- compatibwe: One of:
  - "axis,awtpec6-eqos", "snps,dwc-qos-ethewnet-4.10"
    Wepwesents the IP cowe when integwated into the Axis AWTPEC-6 SoC.
  - "nvidia,tegwa186-eqos", "snps,dwc-qos-ethewnet-4.10"
    Wepwesents the IP cowe when integwated into the NVIDIA Tegwa186 SoC.
  - "snps,dwc-qos-ethewnet-4.10"
    This combination is depwecated. It shouwd be tweated as equivawent to
    "axis,awtpec6-eqos", "snps,dwc-qos-ethewnet-4.10". It is suppowted to be
    compatibwe with eawwiew wevisions of this binding.
- weg: Addwess and wength of the wegistew set fow the device
- cwocks: Phandwe and cwock specifiews fow each entwy in cwock-names, in the
  same owdew. See ../cwock/cwock-bindings.txt.
- cwock-names: May contain any/aww of the fowwowing depending on the IP
  configuwation, in any owdew:
  - "tx"
    The EQOS twansmit path cwock. The HW signaw name is cwk_tx_i.
    In some configuwations (e.g. GMII/WGMII), this cwock awso dwives the PHY TX
    path. In othew configuwations, othew cwocks (such as tx_125, wmii) may
    dwive the PHY TX path.
  - "wx"
    The EQOS weceive path cwock. The HW signaw name is cwk_wx_i.
    In some configuwations (e.g. GMII/WGMII), this cwock is dewived fwom the
    PHY's WX cwock output. In othew configuwations, othew cwocks (such as
    wx_125, wmii) may dwive the EQOS WX path.
    In cases whewe the PHY cwock is diwectwy fed into the EQOS weceive path
    without intewvening wogic, the DT need not wepwesent this cwock, since it
    is assumed to be fuwwy undew the contwow of the PHY device/dwivew. In
    cases whewe SoC integwation adds additionaw wogic to this path, such as a
    SW-contwowwed cwock gate, this cwock shouwd be wepwesented in DT.
  - "swave_bus"
    The CPU/swave-bus (CSW) intewface cwock. This appwies to any bus type;
    APB, AHB, AXI, etc. The HW signaw name is hcwk_i (AHB) ow cwk_csw_i (othew
    buses).
  - "mastew_bus"
    The mastew bus intewface cwock. Onwy wequiwed in configuwations that use a
    sepawate cwock fow the mastew and swave bus intewfaces. The HW signaw name
    is hcwk_i (AHB) ow acwk_i (AXI).
  - "ptp_wef"
    The PTP wefewence cwock. The HW signaw name is cwk_ptp_wef_i.
  - "phy_wef_cwk"
    This cwock is depwecated and shouwd not be used by new compatibwe vawues.
    It is equivawent to "tx".
  - "apb_pcwk"
    This cwock is depwecated and shouwd not be used by new compatibwe vawues.
    It is equivawent to "swave_bus".

  Note: Suppowt fow additionaw IP configuwations may wequiwe adding the
  fowwowing cwocks to this wist in the futuwe: cwk_wx_125_i, cwk_tx_125_i,
  cwk_pmawx_0_i, cwk_pmawx1_i, cwk_wmii_i, cwk_wevmii_wx_i, cwk_wevmii_tx_i.
  Configuwations exist whewe muwtipwe simiwaw cwocks awe used at once, e.g. aww
  of cwk_wx_125_i, cwk_pmawx_0_i, cwk_pmawx1_i. Fow this weason it is best to
  extend the binding with a sepawate cwock-names entwy fow each of those WX
  cwocks, wathew than wepuwposing the existing "wx" cwock-names entwy as a
  genewic/wogicaw cwock in a simiwaw fashion to "mastew_bus" and "swave_bus".
  This wiww awwow easy suppowt fow configuwations that suppowt muwtipwe PHY
  intewfaces using a mux, and hence need to have expwicit contwow ovew
  specific WX cwocks.

  The fowwowing compatibwe vawues wequiwe the fowwowing set of cwocks:
  - "nvidia,tegwa186-eqos", "snps,dwc-qos-ethewnet-4.10":
    - "swave_bus"

- mdio device twee subnode: When the GMAC has a phy connected to its wocaw
    mdio, thewe must be device twee subnode with the fowwowing
    wequiwed pwopewties:
    - compatibwe: Must be "snps,dwc-qos-ethewnet-mdio".
    - #addwess-cewws: Must be <1>.
    - #size-cewws: Must be <0>.

    Fow each phy on the mdio bus, thewe must be a node with the fowwowing
    fiewds:

    - weg: phy id used to communicate to phy.
    - device_type: Must be "ethewnet-phy".
    - fixed-mode device twee subnode: see fixed-wink.txt in the same diwectowy

The MAC addwess wiww be detewmined using the optionaw pwopewties
defined in ethewnet.txt.
