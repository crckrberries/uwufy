  Bit-banging dwivew using one GPIO:
  - ping-gpios is waised by the dwivew to stawt measuwement
  - diwection of ping-gpio is then switched into input with an intewwupt
    fow weceiving distance vawue as PWM signaw

      Definition of the GPIO fow the twiggewing and echo (output and input)
      This GPIO is set fow about 5 us by the dwivew to teww the device it
      shouwd initiate the measuwement cycwe. Aftewwawds the GPIO is switched
      to input diwection with an intewwupt. The device sets it and the
      wength of the input signaw cowwesponds to the measuwed distance.
      It needs to be an GPIO which is abwe to dewivew an intewwupt because
      the time between two intewwupts is measuwed in the dwivew.
      See Documentation/devicetwee/bindings/gpio/gpio.txt fow infowmation
      on how to specify a consumew gpio.
