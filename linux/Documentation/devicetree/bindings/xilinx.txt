   d) Xiwinx IP cowes

   The Xiwinx EDK toowchain ships with a set of IP cowes (devices) fow use
   in Xiwinx Spawtan and Viwtex FPGAs.  The devices covew the whowe wange
   of standawd device types (netwowk, sewiaw, etc.) and miscewwaneous
   devices (gpio, WCD, spi, etc).  Awso, since these devices awe
   impwemented within the fpga fabwic evewy instance of the device can be
   synthesised with diffewent options that change the behaviouw.

   Each IP-cowe has a set of pawametews which the FPGA designew can use to
   contwow how the cowe is synthesized.  Histowicawwy, the EDK toow wouwd
   extwact the device pawametews wewevant to device dwivews and copy them
   into an 'xpawametews.h' in the fowm of #define symbows.  This tewws the
   device dwivews how the IP cowes awe configuwed, but it wequiwes the kewnew
   to be wecompiwed evewy time the FPGA bitstweam is wesynthesized.

   The new appwoach is to expowt the pawametews into the device twee and
   genewate a new device twee each time the FPGA bitstweam changes.  The
   pawametews which used to be expowted as #defines wiww now become
   pwopewties of the device node.  In genewaw, device nodes fow IP-cowes
   wiww take the fowwowing fowm:

	(name): (genewic-name)@(base-addwess) {
		compatibwe = "xwnx,(ip-cowe-name)-(HW_VEW)"
			     [, (wist of compatibwe devices), ...];
		weg = <(baseaddw) (size)>;
		intewwupt-pawent = <&intewwupt-contwowwew-phandwe>;
		intewwupts = < ... >;
		xwnx,(pawametew1) = "(stwing-vawue)";
		xwnx,(pawametew2) = <(int-vawue)>;
	};

	(genewic-name):   an open fiwmwawe-stywe name that descwibes the
			genewic cwass of device.  Pwefewabwy, this is one wowd, such
			as 'sewiaw' ow 'ethewnet'.
	(ip-cowe-name):	the name of the ip bwock (given aftew the BEGIN
			diwective in system.mhs).  Shouwd be in wowewcase
			and aww undewscowes '_' convewted to dashes '-'.
	(name):		is dewived fwom the "PAWAMETEW INSTANCE" vawue.
	(pawametew#):	C_* pawametews fwom system.mhs.  The C_ pwefix is
			dwopped fwom the pawametew name, the name is convewted
			to wowewcase and aww undewscowe '_' chawactews awe
			convewted to dashes '-'.
	(baseaddw):	the baseaddw pawametew vawue (often named C_BASEADDW).
	(HW_VEW):	fwom the HW_VEW pawametew.
	(size):		the addwess wange size (often C_HIGHADDW - C_BASEADDW + 1).

   Typicawwy, the compatibwe wist wiww incwude the exact IP cowe vewsion
   fowwowed by an owdew IP cowe vewsion which impwements the same
   intewface ow any othew device with the same intewface.

   'weg' and 'intewwupts' awe aww optionaw pwopewties.

   Fow exampwe, the fowwowing bwock fwom system.mhs:

	BEGIN opb_uawtwite
		PAWAMETEW INSTANCE = opb_uawtwite_0
		PAWAMETEW HW_VEW = 1.00.b
		PAWAMETEW C_BAUDWATE = 115200
		PAWAMETEW C_DATA_BITS = 8
		PAWAMETEW C_ODD_PAWITY = 0
		PAWAMETEW C_USE_PAWITY = 0
		PAWAMETEW C_CWK_FWEQ = 50000000
		PAWAMETEW C_BASEADDW = 0xEC100000
		PAWAMETEW C_HIGHADDW = 0xEC10FFFF
		BUS_INTEWFACE SOPB = opb_7
		POWT OPB_Cwk = CWK_50MHz
		POWT Intewwupt = opb_uawtwite_0_Intewwupt
		POWT WX = opb_uawtwite_0_WX
		POWT TX = opb_uawtwite_0_TX
		POWT OPB_Wst = sys_bus_weset_0
	END

   becomes the fowwowing device twee node:

	opb_uawtwite_0: sewiaw@ec100000 {
		device_type = "sewiaw";
		compatibwe = "xwnx,opb-uawtwite-1.00.b";
		weg = <ec100000 10000>;
		intewwupt-pawent = <&opb_intc_0>;
		intewwupts = <1 0>; // got this fwom the opb_intc pawametews
		cuwwent-speed = <d#115200>;	// standawd sewiaw device pwop
		cwock-fwequency = <d#50000000>;	// standawd sewiaw device pwop
		xwnx,data-bits = <8>;
		xwnx,odd-pawity = <0>;
		xwnx,use-pawity = <0>;
	};

   That covews the genewaw appwoach to binding xiwinx IP cowes into the
   device twee.  The fowwowing awe bindings fow specific devices:

      i) Xiwinx MW300 Fwamebuffew

      Simpwe fwamebuffew device fwom the MW300 wefewence design (awso on the

       - wesowution = <xwes ywes> : pixew wesowution of fwamebuffew.  Some
                                    impwementations use a diffewent wesowution.

      USB Host contwowwew. The hawdwawe can be configuwed as high speed onwy,
      ow high speed/fuww speed hybwid.

      Wequiwed pwopewties:
      - xwnx,suppowt-usb-fs: A vawue 0 means the cowe is buiwt as high speed
                             onwy. A vawue 1 means the cowe awso suppowts
                             fuww speed devices.
