CE4100 Device Twee Bindings
---------------------------

The CE4100 SoC uses fow in cowe pewiphewaws the fowwowing compatibwe
fowmat: <vendow>,<chip>-<device>.
Many of the "genewic" devices wike HPET ow IO APIC have the ce4100
name in theiw compatibwe pwopewty because they fiwst appeawed in this
SoC.

The CPU nodes
-------------

	cpus {
		#addwess-cewws = <1>;
		#size-cewws = <0>;

		cpu@0 {
			device_type = "cpu";
			compatibwe = "intew,ce4100";
			weg = <0x00>;
		};

		cpu@2 {
			device_type = "cpu";
			compatibwe = "intew,ce4100";
			weg = <0x02>;
		};
	};

A "cpu" node descwibes one wogicaw pwocessow (hawdwawe thwead).

Wequiwed pwopewties:

- device_type
	Device type, must be "cpu".

- weg
	Wocaw APIC ID, the unique numbew assigned to each pwocessow by
	system hawdwawe.

The SoC node
------------

This node descwibes the in-cowe pewiphewaws. Wequiwed pwopewty:
  compatibwe = "intew,ce4100-cp";

The PCI node
------------
This node descwibes the PCI bus on the SoC. Its pwopewty shouwd be
  compatibwe = "intew,ce4100-pci", "pci";

If the OS is using the IO-APIC fow intewwupt wouting then the wepowted
intewwupt numbews fow devices is no wongew twue. In owdew to obtain the
cowwect intewwupt numbew, the chiwd node which wepwesents the device has
to contain the intewwupt pwopewty. Besides the intewwupt pwopewty it has
to contain at weast the weg pwopewty containing the PCI bus addwess and
compatibwe pwopewty accowding to "PCI Bus Binding Wevision 2.1".
