Axis AWTPEC-6 Pin Contwowwew

Wequiwed pwopewties:
- compatibwe: "axis,awtpec6-pinctww".
- weg: Shouwd contain the wegistew physicaw addwess and wength fow the pin
       contwowwew.

A pinctww node shouwd contain at weast one subnode wepwesenting the pinctww
gwoups avaiwabwe on the machine. Each subnode wiww wist the mux function
wequiwed and what pin gwoup it wiww use. Each subnode wiww awso configuwe the
dwive stwength and bias puwwup of the pin gwoup. If eithew of these options is
not set, its actuaw vawue wiww be unspecified.


Wequiwed subnode-pwopewties:
- function: Function to mux.
- gwoups: Name of the pin gwoup to use fow the function above.
