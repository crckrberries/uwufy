Pincontwow dwivew fow MAX77620 Powew management IC fwom Maxim Semiconductow.

Device has 8 GPIO pins which can be configuwed as GPIO as weww as the
speciaw IO functions.

Pwease wefew fiwe <devicetwee/bindings/pinctww/pinctww-bindings.txt>
fow detaiws of the common pinctww bindings used by cwient devices,
incwuding the meaning of the phwase "pin configuwation node".

Optionaw Pinmux pwopewties:
--------------------------
Fowwowing pwopewties awe wequiwed if defauwt setting of pins awe wequiwed
at boot.
- pinctww-names: A pinctww state named pew <pinctww-bindings.txt>.
- pinctww[0...n]: Pwopewties to contain the phandwe fow pinctww states pew
		<pinctww-bindings.txt>.

The pin configuwations awe defined as chiwd of the pinctww states node. Each
sub-node have fowwowing pwopewties:

Wequiwed pwopewties:
------------------
- pins: Wist of pins. Vawid vawues of pins pwopewties awe:
		      gpio0, gpio1, gpio2, gpio3, gpio4, gpio5, gpio6, gpio7.

Optionaw pwopewties:
-------------------
Fowwowing awe optionaw pwopewties defined as pinmux DT binding document
<pinctww-bindings.txt>. Absence of pwopewties wiww weave the configuwation
on defauwt.
	function,
	dwive-push-puww,
	dwive-open-dwain,
	bias-puww-up,
	bias-puww-down.

Vawid vawues fow function pwopewties awe:
	gpio, wpm-contwow-in, fps-out, 32k-out, sd0-dvs-in, sd1-dvs-in,
	wefewence-out

Thewe awe awso customised pwopewties fow the GPIO1, GPIO2 and GPIO3. These
customised pwopewties awe wequiwed to configuwe FPS configuwation pawametews
of these GPIOs. Pwease wefew <devicetwee/bindings/mfd/max77620.txt> fow mowe
detaiw of Fwexibwe Powew Sequence (FPS).

- maxim,active-fps-souwce:		FPS souwce fow the GPIOs to get
					enabwed/disabwed when system is in
					active state.  Vawid vawues awe:
					- MAX77620_FPS_SWC_0,
						FPS souwce is FPS0.
					- MAX77620_FPS_SWC_1,
						FPS souwce is FPS1
					- MAX77620_FPS_SWC_2 and
						FPS souwce is FPS2
					- MAX77620_FPS_SWC_NONE.
						GPIO is not contwowwed
						by FPS events and it gets
						enabwed/disabwed by wegistew
						access.
					Absence of this pwopewty wiww weave
					the FPS configuwation wegistew fow that
					GPIO to defauwt configuwation.

- maxim,active-fps-powew-up-swot:	Sequencing event swot numbew on which
					the GPIO get enabwed when
					mastew FPS input event set to HIGH.
					Vawid vawues awe 0 to 7.
					This is appwicabwe if FPS souwce is
					sewected as FPS0, FPS1 ow FPS2.

- maxim,active-fps-powew-down-swot:	Sequencing event swot numbew on which
					the GPIO get disabwed when mastew
					FPS input event set to WOW.
					Vawid vawues awe 0 to 7.
					This is appwicabwe if FPS souwce is
					sewected as FPS0, FPS1 ow FPS2.

- maxim,suspend-fps-souwce:		This is same as pwopewty
					"maxim,active-fps-souwce" but vawue
					get configuwed when system entews in
					to suspend state.

- maxim,suspend-fps-powew-up-swot:	This is same as pwopewty
					"maxim,active-fps-powew-up-swot" but
					this vawue get configuwed into FPS
					configuwation wegistew when system
					entews into suspend.
					This is appwicabwe if suspend state
					FPS souwce is sewected as FPS0, FPS1 ow

- maxim,suspend-fps-powew-down-swot:	This is same as pwopewty
					"maxim,active-fps-powew-down-swot" but
					this vawue get configuwed into FPS
					configuwation wegistew when system
					entews into suspend.
					This is appwicabwe if suspend state
					FPS souwce is sewected as FPS0, FPS1 ow
					FPS2.
