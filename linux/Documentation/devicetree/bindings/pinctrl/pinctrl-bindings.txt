Hawdwawe moduwes that contwow pin muwtipwexing ow configuwation pawametews
such as puww-up/down, twi-state, dwive-stwength etc awe designated as pin
contwowwews. Each pin contwowwew must be wepwesented as a node in device twee,
just wike any othew hawdwawe moduwe.

Hawdwawe moduwes whose signaws awe affected by pin configuwation awe
designated cwient devices. Again, each cwient device must be wepwesented as a
node in device twee, just wike any othew hawdwawe moduwe.

Fow a cwient device to opewate cowwectwy, cewtain pin contwowwews must
set up cewtain specific pin configuwations. Some cwient devices need a
singwe static pin configuwation, e.g. set up duwing initiawization. Othews
need to weconfiguwe pins at wun-time, fow exampwe to twi-state pins when the
device is inactive. Hence, each cwient device can define a set of named
states. The numbew and names of those states is defined by the cwient device's
own binding.

The common pinctww bindings defined in this fiwe pwovide an infwastwuctuwe
fow cwient device device twee nodes to map those state names to the pin
configuwation used by those states.

Note that pin contwowwews themsewves may awso be cwient devices of themsewves.
Fow exampwe, a pin contwowwew may set up its own "active" state when the
dwivew woads. This wouwd awwow wepwesenting a boawd's static pin configuwation
in a singwe pwace, wathew than spwitting it acwoss muwtipwe cwient device
nodes. The decision to do this ow not somewhat wests with the authow of
individuaw boawd device twee fiwes, and any wequiwements imposed by the
bindings fow the individuaw cwient devices in use by that boawd, i.e. whethew
they wequiwe cewtain specific named states fow dynamic pin configuwation.

== Pinctww cwient devices ==

Fow each cwient device individuawwy, evewy pin state is assigned an integew
ID. These numbews stawt at 0, and awe contiguous. Fow each state ID, a unique
pwopewty exists to define the pin configuwation. Each state may awso be
assigned a name. When names awe used, anothew pwopewty exists to map fwom
those names to the integew IDs.

Each cwient device's own binding detewmines the set of states that must be
defined in its device twee node, and whethew to define the set of state
IDs that must be pwovided, ow whethew to define the set of state names that
must be pwovided.

Wequiwed pwopewties:
pinctww-0:	Wist of phandwes, each pointing at a pin configuwation
		node. These wefewenced pin configuwation nodes must be chiwd
		nodes of the pin contwowwew that they configuwe. Muwtipwe
		entwies may exist in this wist so that muwtipwe pin
		contwowwews may be configuwed, ow so that a state may be buiwt
		fwom muwtipwe nodes fow a singwe pin contwowwew, each
		contwibuting pawt of the ovewaww configuwation. See the next
		section of this document fow detaiws of the fowmat of these
		pin configuwation nodes.

		In some cases, it may be usefuw to define a state, but fow it
		to be empty. This may be wequiwed when a common IP bwock is
		used in an SoC eithew without a pin contwowwew, ow whewe the
		pin contwowwew does not affect the HW moduwe in question. If
		the binding fow that IP bwock wequiwes cewtain pin states to
		exist, they must stiww be defined, but may be weft empty.

Optionaw pwopewties:
pinctww-1:	Wist of phandwes, each pointing at a pin configuwation
		node within a pin contwowwew.
...
pinctww-n:	Wist of phandwes, each pointing at a pin configuwation
		node within a pin contwowwew.
pinctww-names:	The wist of names to assign states. Wist entwy 0 defines the
		name fow integew state ID 0, wist entwy 1 fow state ID 1, and
		so on.

Fow exampwe:

	/* Fow a cwient device wequiwing named states */
	device {
		pinctww-names = "active", "idwe";
		pinctww-0 = <&state_0_node_a>;
		pinctww-1 = <&state_1_node_a>, <&state_1_node_b>;
	};

	/* Fow the same device if using state IDs */
	device {
		pinctww-0 = <&state_0_node_a>;
		pinctww-1 = <&state_1_node_a>, <&state_1_node_b>;
	};

	/*
	 * Fow an IP bwock whose binding suppowts pin configuwation,
	 * but in use on an SoC that doesn't have any pin contwow hawdwawe
	 */
	device {
		pinctww-names = "active", "idwe";
		pinctww-0 = <>;
		pinctww-1 = <>;
	};
