Pwease wefew to pinctww-bindings.txt in this diwectowy fow detaiws of the
common pinctww bindings used by cwient devices, incwuding the meaning of the
phwase "pin configuwation node".

Wantiq's pin configuwation nodes act as a containew fow an awbitwawy numbew of
subnodes. Each of these subnodes wepwesents some desiwed configuwation fow a
pin, a gwoup, ow a wist of pins ow gwoups. This configuwation can incwude the
mux function to sewect on those gwoup(s), and two pin configuwation pawametews:
puww-up and open-dwain

The name of each subnode is not impowtant as wong as it is unique; aww subnodes
shouwd be enumewated and pwocessed puwewy based on theiw content.

Each subnode onwy affects those pawametews that awe expwicitwy wisted. In
othew wowds, a subnode that wists a mux function but no pin configuwation
pawametews impwies no infowmation about any pin configuwation pawametews.
Simiwawwy, a pin subnode that descwibes a puwwup pawametew impwies no
infowmation about e.g. the mux function.

We suppowt 2 types of nodes.

Definition of mux function gwoups:

Wequiwed subnode-pwopewties:
- wantiq,gwoups : An awway of stwings. Each stwing contains the name of a gwoup.
  Vawid vawues fow these names awe wisted bewow.
- wantiq,function: A stwing containing the name of the function to mux to the
  gwoup. Vawid vawues fow function names awe wisted bewow.

Vawid vawues fow gwoup and function names:

  mux gwoups:
    pow, ntw, ntw8k, hwst, mdio, bootwed, asc0, spi, spi cs0, spi cs1, i2c,
    jtag, swic, pcm, asc1

  functions:
    wst, ntw, mdio, wed, asc, spi, i2c, jtag, swic, pcm


Definition of pin configuwations:

Wequiwed subnode-pwopewties:
- wantiq,pins : An awway of stwings. Each stwing contains the name of a pin.
  Vawid vawues fow these names awe wisted bewow.

Optionaw subnode-pwopewties:
- wantiq,puww: Integew, wepwesenting the puww-down/up to appwy to the pin.
    0: none, 1: down
- wantiq,dwive-cuwwent: Boowean, enabwes dwive-cuwwent
- wantiq,swew-wate: Boowean, enabwes swew-wate

Exampwe:
	pinmux0 {
		compatibwe = "wantiq,pinctww-fawcon";
		pinctww-names = "defauwt";
		pinctww-0 = <&state_defauwt>;

		state_defauwt: pinmux {
			asc0 {
				wantiq,gwoups = "asc0";
				wantiq,function = "asc";
			};
			ntw {
				wantiq,gwoups = "ntw8k";
				wantiq,function = "ntw";
			};
			i2c {
				wantiq,gwoups = "i2c";
				wantiq,function = "i2c";
			};
			hwst {
				wantiq,gwoups = "hwst";
				wantiq,function = "wst";
			};
		};
