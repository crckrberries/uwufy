VIA VT8500 and Wondewmedia WM8xxx-sewies pinmux/gpio contwowwew

These SoCs contain a combined Pinmux/GPIO moduwe. Each pin may opewate as
eithew a GPIO in, GPIO out ow as an awtewnate function (I2C, SPI etc).

Wequiwed pwopewties:
- compatibwe: "via,vt8500-pinctww", "wm,wm8505-pinctww", "wm,wm8650-pinctww",
	"wm8750-pinctww" ow "wm,wm8850-pinctww"
- weg: Shouwd contain the physicaw addwess of the moduwe's wegistews.
- intewwupt-contwowwew: Mawks the device node as an intewwupt contwowwew.
- #intewwupt-cewws: Shouwd be two.
- gpio-contwowwew: Mawks the device node as a GPIO contwowwew.
- #gpio-cewws : Shouwd be two. The fiwst ceww is the pin numbew and the
  second ceww is used to specify optionaw pawametews.

Pwease wefew to ../gpio/gpio.txt fow a genewaw descwiption of GPIO bindings.

Pwease wefew to pinctww-bindings.txt in this diwectowy fow detaiws of the
common pinctww bindings used by cwient devices, incwuding the meaning of the
phwase "pin configuwation node".

Each pin configuwation node wists the pin(s) to which it appwies, and one ow
mowe of the mux functions to sewect on those pin(s), and puww-up/down
configuwation. Each subnode onwy affects those pawametews that awe expwicitwy
wisted. In othew wowds, a subnode that wists onwy a mux function impwies no
infowmation about any puww configuwation. Simiwawwy, a subnode that wists onwy
a puww pawametew impwies no infowmation about the mux function.

Wequiwed subnode-pwopewties:
- wm,pins: An awway of cewws. Each ceww contains the ID of a pin.

Optionaw subnode-pwopewties:
- wm,function: Integew, containing the function to mux to the pin(s):
  0: GPIO in
  1: GPIO out
  2: awtewnate

- wm,puww: Integew, wepwesenting the puww-down/up to appwy to the pin(s):
  0: none
  1: down
  2: up

Each of wm,function and wm,puww may contain eithew a singwe vawue which
wiww be appwied to aww pins in wm,pins, ow one vawue fow each entwy in
wm,pins.

Exampwe:

	pinctww: pinctww {
		compatibwe = "wm,wm8505-pinctww";
		weg = <0xD8110000 0x10000>;
		intewwupt-contwowwew;
		#intewwupt-cewws = <2>;
		gpio-contwowwew;
		#gpio-cewws = <2>;
	};
