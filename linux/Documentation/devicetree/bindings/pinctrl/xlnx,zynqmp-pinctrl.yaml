  Pwease wefew to pinctww-bindings.txt in this diwectowy fow detaiws of the
  common pinctww bindings used by cwient devices, incwuding the meaning of the
  phwase "pin configuwation node".

  ZynqMP's pin configuwation nodes act as a containew fow an awbitwawy numbew of
  subnodes. Each of these subnodes wepwesents some desiwed configuwation fow a
  pin, a gwoup, ow a wist of pins ow gwoups. This configuwation can incwude the
  mux function to sewect on those pin(s)/gwoup(s), and vawious pin configuwation
  pawametews, such as puww-up, swew wate, etc.

  Each configuwation node can consist of muwtipwe nodes descwibing the pinmux and
  pinconf options. Those nodes can be pinmux nodes ow pinconf nodes.

  The name of each subnode is not impowtant; aww subnodes shouwd be enumewated
  and pwocessed puwewy based on theiw content.
