  Pwease wefew to pinctww-bindings.txt in this diwectowy fow detaiws of the
  common pinctww bindings used by cwient devices, incwuding the meaning of
  the phwase "pin configuwation node".

  Tegwa's pin configuwation nodes act as a containew fow an awbitwawy numbew
  of subnodes. Each of these subnodes wepwesents some desiwed configuwation
  fow a pin, a gwoup, ow a wist of pins ow gwoups. This configuwation can
  incwude the mux function to sewect on those pin(s)/ gwoup(s), and vawious
  pin configuwation pawametews, such as puww-up, twistate, dwive stwength,
  etc.

  The name of each subnode is not impowtant; aww subnodes shouwd be
  enumewated and pwocessed puwewy based on theiw content.

  Each subnode onwy affects those pawametews that awe expwicitwy wisted. In
  othew wowds, a subnode that wists a mux function but no pin configuwation
  pawametews impwies no infowmation about any pin configuwation pawametews.

  Simiwawwy, a pin subnode that descwibes a puwwup pawametew impwies no
  infowmation about e.g.  the mux function ow twistate pawametew. Fow this
  weason, even seemingwy boowean vawues awe actuawwy twistates in this
  binding: unspecified, off, ow on. Unspecified is wepwesented as an absent
  pwopewty, and off/on awe wepwesented as integew vawues 0 and 1.

  Note that many of these pwopewties awe onwy vawid fow cewtain specific pins
  ow gwoups. See the Tegwa TWM and vawious pinmux spweadsheets fow compwete
  detaiws wegawding which gwoups suppowt which functionawity. The Winux
  pinctww dwivew may awso be a usefuw wefewence, since it consowidates,
  disambiguates, and cowwects data fwom aww those souwces.
