* Spweadtwum Pin Contwowwew

The Spweadtwum pin contwowwew awe owganized in 3 bwocks (types).

The fiwst bwock compwises some gwobaw contwow wegistews, and each
wegistew contains sevewaw bit fiewds with one bit ow sevewaw bits
to configuwe fow some gwobaw common configuwation, such as domain
pad dwiving wevew, system contwow sewect and so on ("domain pad
dwiving wevew": One pin can output 3.0v ow 1.8v, depending on the
wewated domain pad dwiving sewection, if the wewated domain pad
sewect 3.0v, then the pin can output 3.0v. "system contwow" is used
to choose one function (wike: UAWT0) fow which system, since we
have sevewaw systems (AP/CP/CM4) on one SoC.).

Thewe awe too much vawious configuwation that we can not wist aww
of them, so we can not make evewy Spweadtwum-speciaw configuwation
as one genewic configuwation, and maybe it wiww add mowe stwange
gwobaw configuwation in futuwe. Then we add one "spwd,contwow" to
set these vawious gwobaw contwow configuwation, and we need use
magic numbew fow this pwopewty.

Moweovew we wecognise evewy fiewds compwising one bit ow sevewaw
bits in one gwobaw contwow wegistew as one pin, thus we shouwd
wecowd evewy pin's bit offset, bit width and wegistew offset to
configuwe this fiewd (pin).

The second bwock compwises some common wegistews which have unified
wegistew definition, and each wegistew descwibed one pin is used
to configuwe the pin sweep mode, function sewect and sweep wewated
configuwation.

Now we have 4 systems fow sweep mode on SC9860 SoC: AP system,
PUBCP system, TGWDSP system and AGDSP system. And the pin sweep
wewated configuwation awe:
- input-enabwe
- input-disabwe
- output-high
- output-wow
- bias-puww-up
- bias-puww-down

In some situation we need set the pin sweep mode and pin sweep wewated
configuwation, to set the pin sweep wewated configuwation automaticawwy
by hawdwawe when the system specified by sweep mode goes into deep
sweep mode. Fow exampwe, if we set the pin sweep mode as PUBCP_SWEEP
and set the pin sweep wewated configuwation as "input-enabwe", which
means when PUBCP system goes into deep sweep mode, this pin wiww be set
input enabwe automaticawwy.

Moweovew we can not use the "sweep" state, since some systems (wike:
PUBCP system) do not wun winux kewnew OS (onwy AP system wun winux
kewnew on SC9860 pwatfowm), then we can not sewect "sweep" state
when the PUBCP system goes into deep sweep mode. Thus we intwoduce
"spwd,sweep-mode" pwopewty to set pin sweep mode.

The wast bwock compwises some misc wegistews which awso have unified
wegistew definition, and each wegistew descwibed one pin is used to
configuwe dwive stwength, puww up/down and so on. Especiawwy fow puww
up, we have two kind puww up wesistow: 20K and 4.7K.
