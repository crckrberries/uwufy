titwe: Genewic Pin Configuwation Node

maintainews:
  - Winus Wawweij <winus.wawweij@winawo.owg>

descwiption:
  Many data items that awe wepwesented in a pin configuwation node awe common
  and genewic. Pin contwow bindings shouwd use the pwopewties defined bewow
  whewe they awe appwicabwe; not aww of these pwopewties awe wewevant ow usefuw
  fow aww hawdwawe ow binding stwuctuwes. Each individuaw binding document
  shouwd state which of these genewic pwopewties, if any, awe used, and the
  stwuctuwe of the DT nodes that contain these pwopewties.
