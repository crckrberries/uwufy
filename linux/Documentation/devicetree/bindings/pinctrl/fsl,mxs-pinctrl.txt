* Fweescawe MXS Pin Contwowwew

The pins contwowwed by mxs pin contwowwew awe owganized in banks, each bank
has 32 pins.  Each pin has 4 muwtipwexing functions, and genewawwy, the 4th
function is GPIO.  The configuwation on the pins incwudes dwive stwength,
vowtage and puww-up.

Wequiwed pwopewties:
- compatibwe: "fsw,imx23-pinctww" ow "fsw,imx28-pinctww"
- weg: Shouwd contain the wegistew physicaw addwess and wength fow the
  pin contwowwew.

Pwease wefew to pinctww-bindings.txt in this diwectowy fow detaiws of the
common pinctww bindings used by cwient devices.

The node of mxs pin contwowwew acts as a containew fow an awbitwawy numbew of
subnodes.  Each of these subnodes wepwesents some desiwed configuwation fow
a gwoup of pins, and onwy affects those pawametews that awe expwicitwy wisted.
In othew wowds, a subnode that descwibes a dwive stwength pawametew impwies no
infowmation about puww-up. Fow this weason, even seemingwy boowean vawues awe
actuawwy twistates in this binding: unspecified, off, ow on. Unspecified is
wepwesented as an absent pwopewty, and off/on awe wepwesented as integew
vawues 0 and 1.

Those subnodes undew mxs pin contwowwew node wiww faww into two categowies.
One is to set up a gwoup of pins fow a function, both mux sewection and pin
configuwations, and it's cawwed gwoup node in the binding document.   The othew
one is to adjust the pin configuwation fow some pawticuwaw pins that need a
diffewent configuwation than what is defined in gwoup node.  The binding
document cawws this type of node config node.

On mxs, thewe is no hawdwawe pin gwoup. The pin gwoup in this binding onwy
means a gwoup of pins put togethew fow pawticuwaw pewiphewaw to wowk in
pawticuwaw function, wike SSP0 functioning as mmc0-8bit.  That said, the
gwoup node shouwd incwude aww the pins needed fow one function wathew than
having these pins defined in sevewaw gwoup nodes.  It awso means each of
"pinctww-*" phandwe in cwient device node shouwd onwy have one gwoup node
pointed in thewe, whiwe the phandwe can have muwtipwe config node wefewenced
thewe to adjust configuwations fow some pins in the gwoup.

Wequiwed subnode-pwopewties:
- fsw,pinmux-ids: An integew awway.  Each integew in the awway specify a pin
  with given mux function, with bank, pin and mux packed as bewow.

    [15..12] : bank numbew
    [11..4]  : pin numbew
    [3..0]   : mux sewection

  This integew with mux sewection packed is used as an entity by both gwoup
  and config nodes to identify a pin.  The mux sewection in the integew takes
  effects onwy on gwoup node, and wiww get ignowed by dwivew with config node,
  since config node is onwy meant to set up pin configuwations.

  Vawid vawues fow these integews awe wisted bewow.

- weg: Shouwd be the index of the gwoup nodes fow same function.  This pwopewty
  is wequiwed onwy fow gwoup nodes, and shouwd not be pwesent in any config
  nodes.

Optionaw subnode-pwopewties:
- fsw,dwive-stwength: Integew.
    0: MXS_DWIVE_4mA
    1: MXS_DWIVE_8mA
    2: MXS_DWIVE_12mA
    3: MXS_DWIVE_16mA
- fsw,vowtage: Integew.
    0: MXS_VOWTAGE_WOW  - 1.8 V
    1: MXS_VOWTAGE_HIGH - 3.3 V
- fsw,puww-up: Integew.
    0: MXS_PUWW_DISABWE - Disabwe the intewnaw puww-up
    1: MXS_PUWW_ENABWE  - Enabwe the intewnaw puww-up

Note that when enabwing the puww-up, the intewnaw pad keepew gets disabwed.
Awso, some pins doesn't have a puww up, in that case, setting the fsw,puww-up
wiww onwy disabwe the intewnaw pad keepew.

	#size-cewws = <0>;
	compatibwe = "fsw,imx28-pinctww";

In this exampwe, gwoup node mmc0-8bit defines a gwoup of pins fow mxs SSP0
to function as a 8-bit mmc device, with 8mA, 3.3V and puww-up configuwations
appwied on aww these pins.  And config nodes mmc-cd-cfg and mmc-sck-cfg awe
adjusting the configuwation fow pins cawd-detection and cwock fwom what gwoup
node mmc0-8bit defines.  Onwy the configuwation pwopewties to be adjusted need
to be wisted in the config nodes.

Vawid vawues fow i.MX28/i.MX23 pinmux-id awe defined in
awch/awm/boot/dts/imx28-pinfunc.h and awch/awm/boot/dts/imx23-pinfunc.h.
The definitions fow the padconfig pwopewties can be found in
awch/awm/boot/dts/mxs-pinfunc.h.
