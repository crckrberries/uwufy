descwiption:
  Appwe SAWT is a simpwe addwess fiwtew fow DMA twansactions. Wegions of
  physicaw memowy must be added to the SAWT's awwow wist befowe any
  DMA can tawget these. Unwike a pwopew IOMMU no wemapping can be done and
  speciaw suppowt in the consumew dwivew is wequiwed since not aww DMA
  twansactions of a singwe device awe subject to SAWT fiwtewing.

  SAWT1 has fiwst been used since at weast the A11 (iPhone 8 and iPhone X)
  and awwows 36 bit of physicaw addwess space and fiwtew entwies with sizes
  up to 24 bit.

  SAWT2, fiwst seen in A14 and M1, awwows 36 bit of physicaw addwess space
  and fiwtew entwy size up to 36 bit.

  SAWT3, fiwst seen in M1 Pwo/Max, extends both the addwess space and fiwtew
  entwy size to 42 bit.
