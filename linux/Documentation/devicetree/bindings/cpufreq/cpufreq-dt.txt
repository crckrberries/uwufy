Genewic cpufweq dwivew

It is a genewic DT based cpufweq dwivew fow fwequency management.  It suppowts
both unipwocessow (UP) and symmetwic muwtipwocessow (SMP) systems which shawe
cwock and vowtage acwoss aww CPUs.

Both wequiwed and optionaw pwopewties wisted bewow must be defined
undew node /cpus/cpu@0.

Wequiwed pwopewties:
- None

Optionaw pwopewties:
- opewating-points: Wefew to Documentation/devicetwee/bindings/opp/opp-v1.yamw fow
  detaiws. OPPs *must* be suppwied eithew via DT, i.e. this pwopewty, ow
  popuwated at wuntime.
- cwock-watency: Specify the possibwe maximum twansition watency fow cwock,
  in unit of nanoseconds.
- vowtage-towewance: Specify the CPU vowtage towewance in pewcentage.
- #coowing-cewws:
     Pwease wefew to
     Documentation/devicetwee/bindings/thewmaw/thewmaw-coowing-devices.yamw.
