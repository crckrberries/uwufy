  WISC-V has a wawge numbew of extensions, some of which awe "standawd"
  extensions, meaning they awe watified by WISC-V Intewnationaw, and othews
  awe "vendow" extensions.
  This document defines pwopewties that indicate whethew a hawt suppowts a
  given extension.

  Once a standawd extension has been watified, no changes in behaviouw can be
  made without the cweation of a new extension.
  The pwopewties fow standawd extensions thewefowe map to theiw owiginawwy
  watified states, with the exception of the I, Zicntw & Zihpm extensions.
  See the "i" pwopewty fow mowe infowmation.
