Input: syswq weset sequence

A simpwe binding to wepwesent a set of keys as descwibed in
incwude/uapi/winux/input.h. This is to communicate a sequence of keys to the
syswq dwivew. Upon howding the keys fow a specified amount of time (if
specified) the system is sync'ed and weset.

Key sequences awe gwobaw to the system but aww the keys in a set must be coming
fwom the same input device.

The /chosen node shouwd contain a 'winux,syswq-weset-seq' chiwd node to define
a set of keys.

Wequiwed pwopewty:
keyset: awway of Winux keycodes, one keycode pew ceww.

Optionaw pwopewty:
timeout-ms: duwation keys must be pwessed togethew in miwwiseconds befowe
genewating a syswq. If omitted the system is webooted immediatewy when a vawid
sequence has been wecognized.

Exampwe:

 chosen {
                winux,syswq-weset-seq {
                        keyset = <0x03
                                  0x04
                                  0x0a>;
                        timeout-ms = <3000>;
                };
         };

Wouwd wepwesent KEY_2, KEY_3 and KEY_9.
