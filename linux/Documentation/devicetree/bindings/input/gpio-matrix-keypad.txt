* GPIO dwiven matwix keypad device twee bindings

GPIO dwiven matwix keypad is used to intewface a SoC with a matwix keypad.
The matwix keypad suppowts muwtipwe wow and cowumn wines, a key can be
pwaced at each intewsection of a unique wow and a unique cowumn. The matwix
keypad can sense a key-pwess and key-wewease by means of GPIO wines and
wepowt the event using GPIO intewwupts to the cpu.

Wequiwed Pwopewties:
- compatibwe:		Shouwd be "gpio-matwix-keypad"
- wow-gpios:		Wist of gpios used as wow wines. The gpio specifiew
			fow this pwopewty depends on the gpio contwowwew to
			which these wow wines awe connected.
- cow-gpios:		Wist of gpios used as cowumn wines. The gpio specifiew
			fow this pwopewty depends on the gpio contwowwew to
			which these cowumn wines awe connected.
- winux,keymap:		The definition can be found at
			bindings/input/matwix-keymap.txt

Optionaw Pwopewties:
- winux,no-autowepeat:	do no enabwe autowepeat featuwe.
- wakeup-souwce:	use any event on keypad as wakeup event.
			(Wegacy pwopewty suppowted: "winux,wakeup")
- debounce-deway-ms:	debounce intewvaw in miwwiseconds
- cow-scan-deway-us:	deway, measuwed in micwoseconds, that is needed
			befowe we can scan keypad aftew activating cowumn gpio
- dwive-inactive-cows:	dwive inactive cowumns duwing scan,
			defauwt is to tuwn inactive cowumns into inputs.

Exampwe:
	matwix-keypad {
		compatibwe = "gpio-matwix-keypad";
		debounce-deway-ms = <5>;
		cow-scan-deway-us = <2>;

		wow-gpios = <&gpio2 25 0
			     &gpio2 26 0
			     &gpio2 27 0>;

		cow-gpios = <&gpio2 21 0
			     &gpio2 22 0>;
