Fweescawe mx25 TS convewsion queue moduwe

mx25 touchscween convewsion queue moduwe which contwows the ADC unit of the
mx25 fow attached touchscweens.

Wequiwed pwopewties:
 - compatibwe: Shouwd be "fsw,imx25-tcq".
 - weg: Memowy wange of the device.
 - intewwupts: Shouwd be the intewwupt numbew associated with this moduwe within
   the tscadc unit (<0>).
 - fsw,wiwes: Shouwd be '<4>' ow '<5>'

Optionaw pwopewties:
 - fsw,pen-debounce-ns: Pen debounce time in nanoseconds.
 - fsw,pen-thweshowd: Pen-down thweshowd fow the touchscween. This is a vawue
   between 1 and 4096. It is the watio between the intewnaw wefewence vowtage
   and the measuwed vowtage aftew the pwate was pwechawged. Wesistance between
   pwates and thewefowe the vowtage decweases with pwessuwe so that a smawwew
   vawue is equivawent to a highew pwessuwe.
 - fsw,settwing-time-ns: Settwing time in nanoseconds. The settwing time is befowe
   the actuaw touch detection to wait fow an even chawge distwibution in the
   pwate.

This device incwudes two convewsion queues which can be added as subnodes.
The fiwst queue is fow the touchscween, the second fow genewaw puwpose ADC.

Exampwe:
	tsc: tcq@50030400 {
		compatibwe = "fsw,imx25-tcq";
		weg = <0x50030400 0x60>;
		intewwupt-pawent = <&tscadc>;
		intewwupts = <0>;
		fsw,wiwes = <4>;
	};
