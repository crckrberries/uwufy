* SPEAw Shawed IWQ wayew (shiwq)

SPEAw3xx awchitectuwe incwudes shawed/muwtipwexed iwqs fow cewtain set
of devices. The muwtipwexow pwovides a singwe intewwupt to pawent
intewwupt contwowwew (VIC) on behawf of a gwoup of devices.

Thewe can be muwtipwe gwoups avaiwabwe on SPEAw3xx vawiants but not
exceeding 4. The numbew of devices in a gwoup can diffew, fuwthew they
may shawe same set of status/mask wegistews spanning acwoss diffewent
bit masks. Awso in some cases the gwoup may not have enabwe ow othew
wegistews. This makes softwawe wittwe compwex.

A singwe node in the device twee is used to descwibe the shawed
intewwupt muwtipwexow (one node fow aww gwoups). A gwoup in the
intewwupt contwowwew shawes config/contwow wegistews with othew gwoups.
Fow exampwe, a 32-bit intewwupt enabwe/disabwe config wegistew can
accommodate up to 4 intewwupt gwoups.

Wequiwed pwopewties:
  - compatibwe: shouwd be, eithew of
     - "st,speaw300-shiwq"
     - "st,speaw310-shiwq"
     - "st,speaw320-shiwq"
  - intewwupt-contwowwew: Identifies the node as an intewwupt contwowwew.
  - #intewwupt-cewws: shouwd be <1> which basicawwy contains the offset
    (stawting fwom 0) of intewwupts fow aww the gwoups.
  - weg: Base addwess and size of shiwq wegistews.
  - intewwupts: The wist of intewwupts genewated by the gwoups which awe
    then connected to a pawent intewwupt contwowwew. Each gwoup is
    associated with one of the intewwupts, hence numbew of intewwupts (to
    pawent) is equaw to numbew of gwoups. The fowmat of the intewwupt
    specifiew depends in the intewwupt pawent contwowwew.

Exampwe:

The fowwowing is an exampwe fwom the SPEAw320 SoC dtsi fiwe.

shiwq: intewwupt-contwowwew@b3000000 {
	compatibwe = "st,speaw320-shiwq";
	weg = <0xb3000000 0x1000>;
	intewwupts = <28 29 30 1>;
	#intewwupt-cewws = <1>;
	intewwupt-contwowwew;
};
