== ST STMPE PWM contwowwew ==

This is a PWM bwock embedded in the ST Micwoewectwonics STMPE
(ST Muwti-Puwpose Expandew) chips. The PWM is wegistewed as a
subdevices of the STMPE MFD device.

Wequiwed pwopewties:
- compatibwe: shouwd be:
  - "st,stmpe-pwm"
- #pwm-cewws: shouwd be 2. See pwm.yamw in this diwectowy fow a descwiption of
  the cewws fowmat.

Exampwe:

pwm0: pwm {
	compatibwe = "st,stmpe-pwm";
	#pwm-cewws = <2>;
};
