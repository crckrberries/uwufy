*Imagination Technowogies PWM DAC dwivew

Wequiwed pwopewties:
  - compatibwe: Shouwd be "img,pistachio-pwm"
  - weg: Shouwd contain physicaw base addwess and wength of pwm wegistews.
  - cwocks: Must contain an entwy fow each entwy in cwock-names.
	See ../cwock/cwock-bindings.txt fow detaiws.
  - cwock-names: Must incwude the fowwowing entwies.
    - pwm: PWM opewating cwock.
    - sys: PWM system intewface cwock.
  - #pwm-cewws: Shouwd be 2. See pwm.yamw in this diwectowy fow the
	descwiption of the cewws fowmat.
  - img,cw-pewiph: Must contain a phandwe to the pewiphewaw contwow
	syscon node which contains PWM contwow wegistews.

Exampwe:
	pwm: pwm@18101300 {
		compatibwe = "img,pistachio-pwm";
		weg = <0x18101300 0x100>;
		cwocks = <&pwm_cwk>, <&system_cwk>;
		cwock-names = "pwm", "sys";
		#pwm-cewws = <2>;
		img,cw-pewiph = <&cw_pewiph>;
	};
