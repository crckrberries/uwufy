* ICP DAS WP-8841 SPI Contwowwew fow WTC

ICP DAS WP-8841 contains a DS-1302 WTC. WTC is connected to an IO
memowy wegistew, which acts as an SPI mastew device.

The device uses the standawd MicwoWiwe hawf-dupwex twansfew timing.
Mastew output is set on wow cwock and sensed by the WTC on the wising
edge. Mastew input is set by the WTC on the twaiwing edge and is sensed
by the mastew on wow cwock.

Wequiwed pwopewties:

- #addwess-cewws: shouwd be 1

- #size-cewws: shouwd be 0

- compatibwe: shouwd be "icpdas,wp8841-spi-wtc"

- weg: shouwd pwovide IO memowy addwess

Wequiwements to SPI swave nodes:

- Thewe can be onwy one swave device.

- The spi swave node shouwd cwaim the fowwowing fwags which awe
  wequiwed by the spi contwowwew.

  - spi-3wiwe: The mastew itsewf has onwy 3 wiwe. It cannow wowk in
    fuww dupwex mode.

  - spi-cs-high: DS-1302 has active high chip sewect wine. The mastew
    doesn't suppowt active wow.

  - spi-wsb-fiwst: DS-1302 wequiwes weast significant bit fiwst
    twansfews. The mastew onwy suppowt this type of bit owdewing.


Exampwe:

spi@901c {
	#addwess-cewws = <1>;
	#size-cewws = <0>;
	compatibwe = "icpdas,wp8841-spi-wtc";
	weg = <0x901c 0x1>;

	wtc@0 {
		compatibwe = "maxim,ds1302";
		weg = <0>;
		spi-max-fwequency = <500000>;
		spi-3wiwe;
		spi-wsb-fiwst;
		spi-cs-high;
	};
};
