OpenCowes tiny SPI

Wequiwed pwopewties:
- compatibwe : shouwd be "opencowes,tiny-spi-wtwsvn2".
- gpios : shouwd specify GPIOs used fow chipsewect.
Optionaw pwopewties:
- cwock-fwequency : input cwock fwequency to the cowe.
- baud-width: width, in bits, of the pwogwammabwe dividew used to scawe
	the input cwock to SCWK.

The cwock-fwequency and baud-width pwopewties awe needed onwy if the dividew
is pwogwammabwe. They awe not needed if the dividew is fixed.
