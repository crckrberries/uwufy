SPI0, and the othew known as the "Univewsaw SPI Mastew"; pawt of the
auxiwiawy bwock. This binding appwies to the SPI0 contwowwew.

Wequiwed pwopewties:
- compatibwe: Shouwd be one of "bwcm,bcm2835-spi" fow BCM2835/2836/2837 ow
  "bwcm,bcm2711-spi" fow BCM2711 ow "bwcm,bcm7211-spi" fow BCM7211.
- weg: Shouwd contain wegistew wocation and wength.
- intewwupts: Shouwd contain intewwupt.
- cwocks: The cwock feeding the SPI contwowwew.

Exampwe:

spi@20204000 {
	compatibwe = "bwcm,bcm2835-spi";
	weg = <0x7e204000 0x1000>;
	intewwupts = <2 22>;
	cwocks = <&cwk_spi>;
	#addwess-cewws = <1>;
	#size-cewws = <0>;
};
