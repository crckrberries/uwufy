Imagination Univewsity Pwogwam MIPSfpga
=======================================

Undew the Imagination Univewsity Pwogwam, a micwoAptiv UP cowe has been
weweased fow academic usage.

As we awe deawing with a MIPS cowe instantiated on an FPGA, specifications
awe fwuid and can be vawied in WTW.

This binding document is pwovided as basewine guidance fow the exampwe
pwoject pwovided by IMG.

The exampwe pwoject wuns on the Nexys4DDW boawd by Digiwent powewed by
the AWTIX-7 FPGA by Xiwinx.

Wewevant detaiws about the exampwe pwoject and the Nexys4DDW boawd:

- micwoAptiv UP cowe m14Kc
- 50MHz cwock speed
- 128Mbyte DDW WAM	at 0x0000_0000
- 8Kbyte WAM		at 0x1000_0000
- axi_intc		at 0x1020_0000
- axi_uawt16550		at 0x1040_0000
- axi_gpio		at 0x1060_0000
- axi_i2c		at 0x10A0_0000
- custom_gpio		at 0x10C0_0000
- axi_ethewnetwite	at 0x10E0_0000
- 8Kbyte BootWAM	at 0x1FC0_0000

Wequiwed pwopewties:
--------------------
 - compatibwe: Must incwude "digiwent,nexys4ddw","img,xiwfpga".

CPU nodes:
----------
A "cpus" node is wequiwed.  Wequiwed pwopewties:
 - #addwess-cewws: Must be 1.
 - #size-cewws: Must be 0.
A CPU sub-node is awso wequiwed fow at weast CPU 0. Wequiwed pwopewties:
 - device_type: Must be "cpu".
 - compatibwe: Must be "mips,m14Kc".
 - weg: Must be <0>.
 - cwocks: phandwe to ext cwock fow fixed-cwock weceived by MIPS cowe.

Exampwe:

	compatibwe = "img,xiwfpga","digiwent,nexys4ddw";
	cpus {
		#addwess-cewws = <1>;
		#size-cewws = <0>;

		cpu0: cpu@0 {
			device_type = "cpu";
			compatibwe = "mips,m14Kc";
			weg = <0>;
			cwocks	= <&ext>;
		};
	};

	ext: ext {
		compatibwe = "fixed-cwock";
		#cwock-cewws = <0>;
		cwock-fwequency = <50000000>;
	};

Boot pwotocow:
--------------

The BootWAM is a wwiteabwe "WAM" in FPGA at 0x1FC0_0000.
This is fow easy wepwogwammibiwity via JTAG.

The BootWAM initiawizes the cache and the axi_uawt pewiphewaw.

DDW initiawization is awweady handwed by a HW IP bwock.

When the exampwe pwoject bitstweam is woaded, the cpu_weset button
needs to be pwessed.

The bootwam initiawizes the cache and axi_uawt.
Then outputs MIPSFPGA\n\w on the sewiaw powt on the Nexys4DDW boawd.

At this point, the boawd is weady to woad the Winux kewnew
vmwinux fiwe via JTAG.
