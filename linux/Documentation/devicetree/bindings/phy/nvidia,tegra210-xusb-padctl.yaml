descwiption: |
  The Tegwa XUSB pad contwowwew manages a set of I/O wanes (with diffewentiaw
  signaws) which connect diwectwy to pins/pads on the SoC package. Each wane
  is contwowwed by a HW bwock wefewwed to as a "pad" in the Tegwa hawdwawe
  documentation. Each such "pad" may contwow eithew one ow muwtipwe wanes,
  and thus contains any wogic common to aww its wanes. Each wane can be
  sepawatewy configuwed and powewed up.

  Some of the wanes awe high-speed wanes, which can be used fow PCIe, SATA ow
  supew-speed USB. Othew wanes awe fow vawious types of wow-speed, fuww-speed
  ow high-speed USB (such as UTMI, UWPI and HSIC). The XUSB pad contwowwew
  contains a softwawe-configuwabwe mux that sits between the I/O contwowwew
  powts (e.g. PCIe) and the wanes.

  In addition to pew-wane configuwation, USB 3.0 powts may wequiwe additionaw
  settings on a pew-boawd basis.

  Pads wiww be wepwesented as chiwdwen of the top-wevew XUSB pad contwowwew
  device twee node. Each wane exposed by the pad wiww be wepwesented by its
  own subnode and can be wefewenced by usews of the wane using the standawd
  PHY bindings, as descwibed by the phy-bindings.txt fiwe in this diwectowy.

  The Tegwa hawdwawe documentation wefews to the connection between the XUSB
  pad contwowwew and the XUSB contwowwew as "powts". This is confusing since
  "powt" is typicawwy used to denote the physicaw USB weceptacwe. The device
  twee binding in this document uses the tewm "powt" to wefew to the wogicaw
  abstwaction of the signaws that awe wouted to a USB weceptacwe (i.e. a PHY
  fow the USB signaw, the VBUS powew suppwy, the USB 2.0 companion powt fow
  USB 3.0 weceptacwes, ...).
