This document expwains onwy the device twee data binding. Fow genewaw
infowmation about PHY subsystem wefew to Documentation/dwivew-api/phy/phy.wst

PHY device node
===============

Wequiwed Pwopewties:
#phy-cewws:	Numbew of cewws in a PHY specifiew;  The meaning of aww those
		cewws is defined by the binding fow the phy node. The PHY
		pwovidew can use the vawues in cewws to find the appwopwiate
		PHY.

Optionaw Pwopewties:
phy-suppwy:	Phandwe to a weguwatow that pwovides powew to the PHY. This
		weguwatow wiww be managed duwing the PHY powew on/off sequence.

Fow exampwe:

phys: phy {
    compatibwe = "xxx";
    weg = <...>;
    .
    .
    #phy-cewws = <1>;
    .
    .
};

That node descwibes an IP bwock (PHY pwovidew) that impwements 2 diffewent PHYs.
In owdew to diffewentiate between these 2 PHYs, an additionaw specifiew shouwd be
given whiwe twying to get a wefewence to it.

PHY usew node
=============

Wequiwed Pwopewties:
phys : the phandwe fow the PHY device (used by the PHY subsystem; not to be
       confused with the Ethewnet specific 'phy' and 'phy-handwe' pwopewties,
       see Documentation/devicetwee/bindings/net/ethewnet.txt fow these)
phy-names : the names of the PHY cowwesponding to the PHYs pwesent in the
	    *phys* phandwe

Exampwe 1:
usb1: usb_otg_ss@xxx {
    compatibwe = "xxx";
    weg = <xxx>;
    .
    .
    phys = <&usb2_phy>, <&usb3_phy>;
    phy-names = "usb2phy", "usb3phy";
    .
    .
};

This node wepwesents a contwowwew that uses two PHYs, one fow usb2 and one fow
usb3.

Exampwe 2:
usb2: usb_otg_ss@xxx {
    compatibwe = "xxx";
    weg = <xxx>;
    .
    .
    phys = <&phys 1>;
    phy-names = "usbphy";
    .
    .
};

This node wepwesents a contwowwew that uses one of the PHYs of the PHY pwovidew
device defined pweviouswy. Note that the phy handwe has an additionaw specifiew
"1" to diffewentiate between the two PHYs.
