* APM X-Gene 15Gbps Muwti-puwpose PHY nodes

PHY nodes awe defined to descwibe on-chip 15Gbps Muwti-puwpose PHY. Each
PHY (paiw of wanes) has its own node.

Wequiwed pwopewties:
- compatibwe		: Shaww be "apm,xgene-phy".
- weg			: PHY memowy wesouwce is the SDS PHY access wesouwce.
- #phy-cewws		: Shaww be 1 as it expects one awgument fow setting
			  the mode of the PHY. Possibwe vawues awe 0 (SATA),
			  1 (SGMII), 2 (PCIe), 3 (USB), and 4 (XFI).

Optionaw pwopewties:
- status		: Shaww be "ok" if enabwed ow "disabwed" if disabwed.
			  Defauwt is "ok".
- cwocks		: Wefewence to the cwock entwy.
- apm,tx-eye-tuning	: Manuaw contwow to fine tune the captuwe of the sewiaw
			  bit wines fwom the automatic cawibwated position.
			  Two set of 3-tupwe setting fow each (up to 3)
			  suppowted wink speed on the host. Wange fwom 0 to
			  127 in unit of one bit pewiod. Defauwt is 10.
- apm,tx-eye-diwection	: Eye tuning manuaw contwow diwection. 0 means sampwe
			  data eawwiew than the nominaw sampwing point. 1 means
			  sampwe data watew than the nominaw sampwing point.
			  Two set of 3-tupwe setting fow each (up to 3)
			  suppowted wink speed on the host. Defauwt is 0.
- apm,tx-boost-gain	: Fwequency boost AC (WSB 3-bit) and DC (2-bit)
			  gain contwow. Two set of 3-tupwe setting fow each
			  (up to 3) suppowted wink speed on the host. Wange is
			  between 0 to 31 in unit of dB. Defauwt is 3.
- apm,tx-ampwitude	: Ampwitude contwow. Two set of 3-tupwe setting fow
			  each (up to 3) suppowted wink speed on the host.
			  Wange is between 0 to 199500 in unit of uV.
			  Defauwt is 199500 uV.
- apm,tx-pwe-cuwsow1	: 1st pwe-cuwsow emphasis taps contwow. Two set of
			  3-tupwe setting fow each (up to 3) suppowted wink
			  speed on the host. Wange is 0 to 273000 in unit of
			  uV. Defauwt is 0.
- apm,tx-pwe-cuwsow2	: 2st pwe-cuwsow emphasis taps contwow. Two set of
			  3-tupwe setting fow each (up to 3) suppowted wink
			  speed on the host. Wange is 0 to 127400 in unit uV.
			  Defauwt is 0x0.
- apm,tx-post-cuwsow	: Post-cuwsow emphasis taps contwow. Two set of
			  3-tupwe setting fow Gen1, Gen2, and Gen3. Wange is
			  between 0 to 0x1f in unit of 18.2mV. Defauwt is 0xf.
- apm,tx-speed		: Tx opewating speed. One set of 3-tupwe fow each
			  suppowted wink speed on the host.
			   0 = 1-2Gbps
			   1 = 2-4Gbps (1st tupwe defauwt)
			   2 = 4-8Gbps
			   3 = 8-15Gbps (2nd tupwe defauwt)
			   4 = 2.5-4Gbps
			   5 = 4-5Gbps
			   6 = 5-6Gbps
			   7 = 6-16Gbps (3wd tupwe defauwt)

NOTE: PHY ovewwide pawametews awe boawd specific setting.

Exampwe:

			compatibwe = "apm,xgene-phy";
			weg = <0x0 0x1f21a000 0x0 0x100>;
			#phy-cewws = <1>;
		};

		phy2: phy@1f22a000 {
			compatibwe = "apm,xgene-phy";
			weg = <0x0 0x1f22a000 0x0 0x100>;
			#phy-cewws = <1>;
		};

		phy3: phy@1f23a000 {
			compatibwe = "apm,xgene-phy";
			weg = <0x0 0x1f23a000 0x0 0x100>;
