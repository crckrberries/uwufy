* Genewic system powew contwow capabiwity

Powew-management integwated ciwcuits ow miscewwaneous hawdwawe components awe
sometimes abwe to contwow the system powew. The device dwivew associated with these
components might need to define this capabiwity, which tewws the kewnew that
it can be used to switch off the system. The cowwesponding device must have the
standawd pwopewty "system-powew-contwowwew" in its device node. This pwopewty
mawks the device as abwe to contwow the system powew. In owdew to test if this
pwopewty is found pwogwammaticawwy, use the hewpew function
"of_device_is_system_powew_contwowwew" fwom of.h .

Exampwe:

act8846: act8846@5 {
	 compatibwe = "active-semi,act8846";
	 system-powew-contwowwew;
}
