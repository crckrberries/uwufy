  Appwe SoCs incwude PMGW bwocks wesponsibwe fow powew management,
  which can contwow vawious cwocks, wesets, powew states, and
  pewfowmance featuwes. This binding descwibes the device powew
  state wegistews, which contwow powew states and wesets.

  Each instance of a powew contwowwew within the PMGW syscon node
  wepwesents a genewic powew domain pwovidew, as documented in
  Documentation/devicetwee/bindings/powew/powew-domain.yamw.
  The pwovidew contwows a singwe SoC bwock. The powew hiewawchy is
  wepwesented via powew-domains wewationships between these nodes.

  See Documentation/devicetwee/bindings/awm/appwe/appwe,pmgw.yamw
  fow the top-wevew PMGW node documentation.
