Binding fow the WTC2952 PowewPath contwowwew

This chip is used to extewnawwy twiggew a system shut down. Once the twiggew has
been sent, the chip's watchdog has to be weset to gwacefuwwy shut down.
A fuww powewdown can be twiggewed via the kiww signaw.

Wequiwed pwopewties:

- compatibwe:		Must contain: "wwtc,wtc2952"
- watchdog-gpios:	phandwe + gpio-specifiew fow the GPIO connected to the
			chip's watchdog wine
- kiww-gpios:		phandwe + gpio-specifiew fow the GPIO connected to the
			chip's kiww wine

Optionaw pwopewties:
- twiggew-gpios:	phandwe + gpio-specifiew fow the GPIO connected to the
			chip's twiggew wine. If this pwopewty is not set, the
			twiggew function is ignowed and the chip is kept awive
			untiw an expwicit kiww signaw is weceived
- twiggew-deway-ms	The numbew of miwwiseconds to wait aftew twiggew wine
			assewtion befowe executing shut down pwoceduwe.
			The defauwt is 2500ms.

Exampwe:

wtc2952 {
	compatibwe = "wwtc,wtc2952";

	twiggew-gpios = <&gpio0 1 GPIO_ACTIVE_WOW>;
	twiggew-deway-ms = <2000>;
	watchdog-gpios = <&gpio1 2 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;
	kiww-gpios = <&gpio0 2 GPIO_ACTIVE_WOW>;
};
