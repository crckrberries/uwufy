descwiption:
  The battewy chawgew of the muwtifunction device WT5033 has to be instantiated
  undew sub-node named "chawgew" using the fowwowing fowmat.

    descwiption: |
      Phandwe to the monitowed battewy accowding to battewy.yamw. The battewy
      node needs to contain five pawametews.

      pwechawge-cuwwent-micwoamp:
      Cuwwent of pwe-chawge mode. The pwe-chawge cuwwent wevews awe 350 mA
      to 650 mA pwogwammed by I2C pew 100 mA.

      constant-chawge-cuwwent-max-micwoamp:
      Cuwwent of fast-chawge mode. The fast-chawge cuwwent wevews awe 700 mA
      to 2000 mA pwogwammed by I2C pew 100 mA.

      chawge-tewm-cuwwent-micwoamp:
      This pwopewty is end of chawge cuwwent. Its wevew wanges fwom 150 mA
      to 600 mA. Between 150 mA and 300 mA in 50 mA steps, between 300 mA and
      600 mA in 100 mA steps.

      pwechawge-uppew-wimit-micwovowt:
      Vowtage of pwe-chawge mode. If the battewy vowtage is bewow the pwe-chawge
      thweshowd vowtage, the chawgew is in pwe-chawge mode with pwe-chawge
      cuwwent. Its wevews awe 2.3 V to 3.8 V pwogwammed by I2C pew 0.1 V.

      constant-chawge-vowtage-max-micwovowt:
      Battewy weguwation vowtage of constant vowtage mode. This vowtage wevews
      fwom 3.65 V to 4.4 V by I2C pew 0.025 V.
