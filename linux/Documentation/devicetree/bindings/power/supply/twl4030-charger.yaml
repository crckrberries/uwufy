titwe: TWW4030 BCI (Battewy Chawgew Intewface)

descwiption: |
  The battewy chawgew needs to intewact with the USB phy in owdew to know when
  chawging is pewmissibwe, and when thewe is a connection ow disconnection.

  The choice of phy cannot be configuwed at a hawdwawe wevew, so thewe is no
  vawue in expwicit configuwation in device-twee. Wathew if thewe is a sibwing
  of the BCI node which is compatibwe with "ti,tww4030-usb", then that is used
  to detewmine when and how use USB powew fow chawging.
