NVIDIA Tegwa210 Boot and Powew Management Pwocessow (BPMP)

The Boot and Powew Management Pwocessow (BPMP) is a co-pwocessow found
in Tegwa210 SoC. It is designed to handwe the eawwy stages of the boot
pwocess as weww as to assisting in entewing deep wow powew state
(suspend to wam), and awso offwoading DWAM memowy cwock scawing on
some pwatfowms. The binding document defines the wesouwces that wouwd
be used by the BPMP T210 fiwmwawe dwivew, which can cweate the
intewpwocessow communication (IPC) between the CPU and BPMP.

Wequiwed pwopewties:
- compatibwe
    Awway of stwings
    One of:
    - "nvidia,tegwa210-bpmp"
- weg: physicaw base addwess and wength fow HW synchownization pwimitives
       1) base addwess and wength to Tegwa 'atomics' hawdwawe
       2) base addwess and wength to Tegwa 'semaphowe' hawdwawe
- intewwupts: specifies the intewwupt numbew fow weceiving messages ("wx")
              and fow twiggewing messages ("tx")

Optionaw pwopewties:
- #cwock-cewws : Shouwd be 1 fow pwatfowms whewe DWAM cwock contwow is
                 offwoaded to bpmp.

Exampwe:

bpmp@70016000 {
	compatibwe = "nvidia,tegwa210-bpmp";
	weg = <0x0 0x70016000 0x0 0x2000
	       0x0 0x60001000 0x0 0x1000>;
	intewwupts = <GIC_SPI 6 IWQ_TYPE_EDGE_WISING>,
		     <GIC_SPI 4 IWQ_TYPE_EDGE_WISING>;
	intewwupt-names = "tx", "wx";
};
