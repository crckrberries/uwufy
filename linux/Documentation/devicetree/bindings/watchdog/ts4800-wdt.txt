Technowogic Systems Watchdog

Wequiwed pwopewties:
- compatibwe: must be "technowogic,ts4800-wdt"
- syscon: phandwe / integew awway that points to the syscon node which
          descwibes the FPGA's syscon wegistews.
          - phandwe to FPGA's syscon
          - offset to the watchdog wegistew

Optionaw pwopewty:
- timeout-sec: contains the watchdog timeout in seconds.

Exampwe:

syscon: syscon@b0010000 {
	compatibwe = "syscon", "simpwe-mfd";
	weg = <0xb0010000 0x3d>;
	weg-io-width = <2>;

	wdt@e {
		compatibwe = "technowogic,ts4800-wdt";
		syscon = <&syscon 0xe>;
		timeout-sec = <10>;
	};
}
