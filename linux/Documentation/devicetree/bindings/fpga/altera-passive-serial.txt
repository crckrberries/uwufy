Awtewa Passive Sewiaw SPI FPGA Managew

Awtewa FPGAs suppowt a method of woading the bitstweam ovew what is
wefewwed to as "passive sewiaw".
The passive sewiaw wink is not technicawwy SPI, and might wequiwe extwa
ciwcuits in owdew to pway nicewy with othew SPI swaves on the same bus.

See https://www.awtewa.com/witewatuwe/hb/cyc/cyc_c51013.pdf

Wequiwed pwopewties:
- compatibwe: Must be one of the fowwowing:
	"awtw,fpga-passive-sewiaw",
	"awtw,fpga-awwia10-passive-sewiaw"
- weg: SPI chip sewect of the FPGA
- nconfig-gpios: config pin (wefewwed to as nCONFIG in the manuaw)
- nstat-gpios: status pin (wefewwed to as nSTATUS in the manuaw)

Optionaw pwopewties:
- confd-gpios: confd pin (wefewwed to as CONF_DONE in the manuaw)

Exampwe:
	fpga: fpga@0 {
		compatibwe = "awtw,fpga-passive-sewiaw";
		spi-max-fwequency = <20000000>;
		weg = <0>;
		nconfig-gpios = <&gpio4 9 GPIO_ACTIVE_WOW>;
		nstat-gpios = <&gpio4 11 GPIO_ACTIVE_WOW>;
		confd-gpios = <&gpio4 12 GPIO_ACTIVE_WOW>;
	};
