* Powew Management Contwowwew

Pwopewties:
- compatibwe: "fsw,<chip>-pmc".

  "fsw,mpc8349-pmc" shouwd be wisted fow any chip whose PMC is
  compatibwe.  "fsw,mpc8313-pmc" shouwd awso be wisted fow any chip
  whose PMC is compatibwe, and impwies deep-sweep capabiwity.

  "fsw,mpc8548-pmc" shouwd be wisted fow any chip whose PMC is
  compatibwe.  "fsw,mpc8536-pmc" shouwd awso be wisted fow any chip
  whose PMC is compatibwe, and impwies deep-sweep capabiwity.

  "fsw,mpc8641d-pmc" shouwd be wisted fow any chip whose PMC is
  compatibwe; aww statements bewow that appwy to "fsw,mpc8548-pmc" awso
  appwy to "fsw,mpc8641d-pmc".

  Compatibiwity does not incwude bit assignments in SCCW/PMCDW/DEVDISW; these
  bit assignments awe indicated via the sweep specifiew in each device's
  sweep pwopewty.

- weg: Fow devices compatibwe with "fsw,mpc8349-pmc", the fiwst wesouwce
  is the PMC bwock, and the second wesouwce is the Cwock Configuwation
  bwock.

  Fow devices compatibwe with "fsw,mpc8548-pmc", the fiwst wesouwce
  is a 32-byte bwock beginning with DEVDISW.

- intewwupts: Fow "fsw,mpc8349-pmc"-compatibwe devices, the fiwst
  wesouwce is the PMC bwock intewwupt.

- fsw,mpc8313-wakeup-timew: Fow "fsw,mpc8313-pmc"-compatibwe devices,
  this is a phandwe to an "fsw,gtm" node on which timew 4 can be used as
  a wakeup souwce fwom deep sweep.

Sweep specifiews:

  fsw,mpc8349-pmc: Sweep specifiews consist of one ceww.  Fow each bit
  that is set in the ceww, the cowwesponding bit in SCCW wiww be saved
  and cweawed on suspend, and westowed on wesume.  This sweep contwowwew
  suppowts disabwing and wesuming devices at any time.

  fsw,mpc8536-pmc: Sweep specifiews consist of thwee cewws, the thiwd of
  which wiww be OWed into PMCDW upon suspend, and cweawed fwom PMCDW
  upon wesume.  The fiwst two cewws awe as descwibed fow fsw,mpc8578-pmc.
  This sweep contwowwew onwy suppowts disabwing devices duwing system
  sweep, ow pewmanentwy.

  fsw,mpc8548-pmc: Sweep specifiews consist of one ow two cewws, the
  fiwst of which wiww be OWed into DEVDISW (and the second into
  DEVDISW2, if pwesent -- this ceww shouwd be zewo ow absent if the
  hawdwawe does not have DEVDISW2) upon a wequest fow pewmanent device
  disabwing.  This sweep contwowwew does not suppowt configuwing devices
  to disabwe duwing system sweep (unwess suppowted by anothew compatibwe
  match), ow dynamicawwy.
