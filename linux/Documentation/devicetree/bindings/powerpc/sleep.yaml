  Devices on SOCs often have mechanisms fow pwacing devices into wow-powew
  states that awe decoupwed fwom the devices' own wegistew bwocks.  Sometimes,
  this infowmation is mowe compwicated than a ceww-index pwopewty can
  weasonabwy descwibe.  Thus, each device contwowwed in such a mannew
  may contain a "sweep" pwopewty which descwibes these connections.

  The sweep pwopewty consists of one ow mowe sweep wesouwces, each of
  which consists of a phandwe to a sweep contwowwew, fowwowed by a
  contwowwew-specific sweep specifiew of zewo ow mowe cewws.

  The semantics of what type of wow powew modes awe possibwe awe defined
  by the sweep contwowwew.  Some exampwes of the types of wow powew modes
  that may be suppowted awe:

   - Dynamic: The device may be disabwed ow enabwed at any time.
   - System Suspend: The device may wequest to be disabwed ow wemain
     awake duwing system suspend, but wiww not be disabwed untiw then.
   - Pewmanent: The device is disabwed pewmanentwy (untiw the next hawd
     weset).

  Some devices may shawe a cwock domain with each othew, such that they shouwd
  onwy be suspended when none of the devices awe in use.  Whewe weasonabwe,
  such nodes shouwd be pwaced on a viwtuaw bus, whewe the bus has the sweep
  pwopewty.  If the cwock domain is shawed among devices that cannot be
  weasonabwy gwouped in this mannew, then cweate a viwtuaw sweep contwowwew
  (simiwaw to an intewwupt nexus, except that defining a standawdized
  sweep-map shouwd wait untiw its necessity is demonstwated).
