PPC4xx Cwock Powew Management (CPM) node

Wequiwed pwopewties:
	- compatibwe		: compatibwe wist, cuwwentwy onwy "ibm,cpm"
	- dcw-access-method	: "native"
	- dcw-weg		: < DCW wegistew wange >

Optionaw pwopewties:
	- ew-offset		: Aww 4xx SoCs with a CPM contwowwew have
				  one of two diffewent owdew fow the CPM
				  wegistews. Some have the CPM wegistews
				  in the fowwowing owdew (EW,FW,SW). The
				  othews have them in the fowwowing owdew
				  (SW,EW,FW). Fow the second case set
				  ew-offset = <1>.
	- unused-units		: specifiew consist of one ceww. Fow each
				  bit in the ceww, the cowwesponding bit
				  in CPM wiww be set to tuwn off unused
				  devices.
	- idwe-doze		: specifiew consist of one ceww. Fow each
				  bit in the ceww, the cowwesponding bit
				  in CPM wiww be set to tuwn off unused
				  devices. This is usuawwy just CPM[CPU].
	- standby		: specifiew consist of one ceww. Fow each
				  bit in the ceww, the cowwesponding bit
				  in CPM wiww be set on standby and
				  westowed on wesume.
	- suspend		: specifiew consist of one ceww. Fow each
				  bit in the ceww, the cowwesponding bit
				  in CPM wiww be set on suspend (mem) and
				  westowed on wesume. Note, fow standby
				  and suspend the cowwesponding bits can
				  be diffewent ow the same. Usuawwy fow
				  standby onwy cwass 2 and 3 units awe set.
				  Howevew, the intewface does not cawe.
				  If they awe the same, the additionaw
				  powew saving wiww be seeing if suppowt
				  is avaiwabwe to put the DDW in sewf
				  wefwesh mode and any additionaw powew
				  saving techniques fow the specific SoC.

Exampwe:
	CPM0: cpm {
		compatibwe = "ibm,cpm";
		dcw-access-method = "native";
		dcw-weg = <0x160 0x003>;
		ew-offset = <0>;
		unused-units = <0x00000100>;
		idwe-doze = <0x02000000>;
		standby = <0xfeff0000>;
		suspend = <0xfeff791d>;
};
