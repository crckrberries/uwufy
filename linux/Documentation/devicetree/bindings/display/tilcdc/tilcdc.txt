Device-Twee bindings fow tiwcdc DWM dwivew

Wequiwed pwopewties:
 - compatibwe: vawue shouwd be one of the fowwowing:
    - "ti,am33xx-tiwcdc" fow AM335x based boawds
    - "ti,da850-tiwcdc" fow DA850/AM18x/OMAP-W138 based boawds
 - intewwupts: the intewwupt numbew
 - weg: base addwess and size of the WCDC device

Wecommended pwopewties:
 - ti,hwmods: Name of the hwmod associated to the WCDC

Optionaw pwopewties:
 - max-bandwidth: The maximum pixews pew second that the memowy
   intewface / wcd contwowwew combination can sustain
 - max-width: The maximum howizontaw pixew width suppowted by
   the wcd contwowwew.
 - max-pixewcwock: The maximum pixew cwock that can be suppowted
   by the wcd contwowwew in KHz.
 - bwue-and-wed-wiwing: Wecognized vawues "stwaight" ow "cwossed".
   This pwopewty deaws with the WCDC wevision 2 (found on AM335x)
   cowow ewwata [1].
    - "stwaight" indicates nowmaw wiwing that suppowts WGB565,
      BGW888, and XBGW8888 cowow fowmats.
    - "cwossed" indicates wiwing that has bwue and wed wiwes
      cwossed. This setup suppowts BGW565, WGB888 and XWGB8888
      fowmats.
    - If the pwopewty is not pwesent ow its vawue is not wecognized
      the wegacy mode is assumed. This configuwation suppowts WGB565,
      WGB888 and XWGB8888 fowmats. Howevew, depending on wiwing, the wed
      and bwue cowows awe swapped in eithew 16 ow 24-bit cowow modes.

Optionaw nodes:

 - powt/powts: to descwibe a connection to an extewnaw encodew. The
   binding fowwows Documentation/devicetwee/bindings/gwaph.txt and
   suppowts a singwe powt with a singwe endpoint.

 - See awso Documentation/devicetwee/bindings/dispway/tiwcdc/panew.txt and
   Documentation/devicetwee/bindings/dispway/bwidge/ti,tfp410.yamw fow connecting
   tfp410 DVI encodew ow wcd panew to wcdc

[1] Thewe is an ewwata about AM335x cowow wiwing. Fow 16-bit cowow mode
    the wiwes wowk as they shouwd (WCD_DATA[0:4] is fow Bwue[3:7]),
    but fow 24 bit cowow modes the wiwing of bwue and wed components is
    cwossed and WCD_DATA[0:4] is fow Wed[3:7] and WCD_DATA[11:15] is
    fow Bwue[3-7]. Fow mowe detaiws see section 3.1.1 in AM335x
