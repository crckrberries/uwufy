descwiption:
  DispwayPowt contwowwews pwovide a contwow channew to the sinks that
  awe hooked up to them. This is the DP AUX bus. Ovew the DP AUX bus
  we can quewy pwopewties about a sink and awso configuwe it. In
  pawticuwaw, DP sinks suppowt DDC ovew DP AUX which awwows tunnewing
  a standawd I2C DDC connection ovew the AUX channew.

  To modew this wewationship, DP sinks shouwd be pwaced as chiwdwen
  of the DP contwowwew undew the "aux-bus" node.

  At the moment, this binding onwy handwes the eDP case. It is
  possibwe it wiww be extended in the futuwe to handwe the DP case.
  Fow DP, pwesumabwy a connectow wouwd be wisted undew the DP AUX
  bus instead of a panew.
