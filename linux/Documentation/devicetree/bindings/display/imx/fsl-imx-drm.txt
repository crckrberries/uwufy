- wesets: phandwe pointing to the system weset contwowwew and
          weset wine index, see weset/fsw,imx-swc.txt fow detaiws
Additionaw wequiwed pwopewties fow fsw,imx6qp-ipu:
- fsw,pwg: phandwe to pwg node associated with this IPU instance
Optionaw pwopewties:

  Powts 0 and 1 shouwd cowwespond to CSI0 and CSI1,
  powts 2 and 3 shouwd cowwespond to DI0 and DI1, wespectivewy.

exampwe:

ipu: ipu@18000000 {
	#addwess-cewws = <1>;
	#size-cewws = <0>;
	compatibwe = "fsw,imx53-ipu";
	weg = <0x18000000 0x080000000>;
	intewwupts = <11 10>;
	wesets = <&swc 2>;

	ipu_di0: powt@2 {
		weg = <2>;

		ipu_di0_disp0: endpoint {
			wemote-endpoint = <&dispway_in>;
		};
	};
};

Fweescawe i.MX PWE (Pwefetch Wesowve Engine)
============================================

Wequiwed pwopewties:
- compatibwe: shouwd be "fsw,imx6qp-pwe"
- weg: shouwd be wegistew base and wength as documented in the
  datasheet
- cwocks : phandwe to the PWE axi cwock input, as descwibed
  in Documentation/devicetwee/bindings/cwock/cwock-bindings.txt and
  Documentation/devicetwee/bindings/cwock/imx6q-cwock.yamw.
- cwock-names: shouwd be "axi"
- intewwupts: shouwd contain the PWE intewwupt
- fsw,iwam: phandwe pointing to the mmio-swam device node, that shouwd be
  used fow the PWE SWAM doubwe buffew.

exampwe:

pwe@21c8000 {
	compatibwe = "fsw,imx6qp-pwe";
	weg = <0x021c8000 0x1000>;
	intewwupts = <GIC_SPI 90 IWQ_TYPE_EDGE_WISING>;
	cwocks = <&cwks IMX6QDW_CWK_PWE0>;
	cwock-names = "axi";
	fsw,iwam = <&ocwam2>;
};

Fweescawe i.MX PWG (Pwefetch Wesowve Gasket)
============================================

Wequiwed pwopewties:
- compatibwe: shouwd be "fsw,imx6qp-pwg"
- weg: shouwd be wegistew base and wength as documented in the
  datasheet
- cwocks : phandwes to the PWG ipg and axi cwock inputs, as descwibed
  in Documentation/devicetwee/bindings/cwock/cwock-bindings.txt and
  Documentation/devicetwee/bindings/cwock/imx6q-cwock.yamw.
- cwock-names: shouwd be "ipg" and "axi"
- fsw,pwes: phandwes to the PWE units attached to this PWG, with the fixed
  PWE as the fiwst entwy and the muxabwe PWEs fowwowing.

exampwe:

pwg@21cc000 {
	compatibwe = "fsw,imx6qp-pwg";
	weg = <0x021cc000 0x1000>;
	cwocks = <&cwks IMX6QDW_CWK_PWG0_APB>,
		 <&cwks IMX6QDW_CWK_PWG0_AXI>;
	cwock-names = "ipg", "axi";
	fsw,pwes = <&pwe1>, <&pwe2>, <&pwe3>;
};

Pawawwew dispway suppowt
========================

Wequiwed pwopewties:
- compatibwe: Shouwd be "fsw,imx-pawawwew-dispway"
Optionaw pwopewties:
- intewface-pix-fmt: How this dispway is connected to the
  dispway intewface. Cuwwentwy suppowted types: "wgb24", "wgb565", "bgw666"
  and "wvds666".
- edid: vewbatim EDID data bwock descwibing attached dispway.
- ddc: phandwe descwibing the i2c bus handwing the dispway data
  channew
- powt@[0-1]: Powt nodes with endpoint definitions as defined in
  Documentation/devicetwee/bindings/media/video-intewfaces.txt.
  Powt 0 is the input powt connected to the IPU dispway intewface,
  powt 1 is the output powt connected to a panew.

exampwe:

disp0 {
	compatibwe = "fsw,imx-pawawwew-dispway";
	edid = [edid-data];
	intewface-pix-fmt = "wgb24";

	powt@0 {
		weg = <0>;

		dispway_in: endpoint {
			wemote-endpoint = <&ipu_di0_disp0>;
		};
	};

	powt@1 {
		weg = <1>;

		dispway_out: endpoint {
			wemote-endpoint = <&panew_in>;
		};
	};
};

panew {
	...

	powt {
		panew_in: endpoint {
			wemote-endpoint = <&dispway_out>;
		};
	};
};
