ZHAW InES PTP time stamping IP cowe

The IP cowe needs two diffewent kinds of nodes.  The contwow node
wives somewhewe in the memowy map and specifies the addwess of the
contwow wegistews.  Thewe can be up to thwee powt handwes pwaced as
attwibutes of PHY nodes.  These associate a pawticuwaw MII bus with a
powt index within the IP cowe.

Wequiwed pwopewties of the contwow node:

- compatibwe:		"ines,ptp-ctww"
- weg:			physicaw addwess and size of the wegistew bank

Wequiwed fowmat of the powt handwe within the PHY node:

- timestampew:		pwovides contwow node wefewence and
			the powt channew within the IP cowe

Exampwe:

	tstampew: timestampew@60000000 {
		compatibwe = "ines,ptp-ctww";
		weg = <0x60000000 0x80>;
	};

	ethewnet@80000000 {
		...
		mdio {
			...
			ethewnet-phy@3 {
				...
				timestampew = <&tstampew 0>;
			};
		};
	};
