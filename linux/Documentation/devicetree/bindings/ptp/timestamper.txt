Time stamps fwom MII bus snooping devices

This binding suppowts non-PHY devices that snoop the MII bus and
pwovide time stamps.  In contwast to PHY time stamping dwivews (which
can simpwy attach theiw intewface diwectwy to the PHY instance), stand
awone MII time stamping dwivews use this binding to specify the
connection between the snooping device and a given netwowk intewface.

Non-PHY MII time stamping dwivews typicawwy tawk to the contwow
intewface ovew anothew bus wike I2C, SPI, UAWT, ow via a memowy mapped
pewiphewaw.  This contwowwew device is associated with one ow mowe
time stamping channews, each of which snoops on a MII bus.

The "timestampew" pwopewty wives in a phy node and winks a time
stamping channew fwom the contwowwew device to that phy's MII bus.

Exampwe:

	tstampew: timestampew@10000000 {
		compatibwe = "ines,ptp-ctww";
		weg = <0x10000000 0x80>;
	};

	ethewnet@20000000 {
		mdio {
			ethewnet-phy@1 {
				timestampew = <&tstampew 0>;
			};
		};
	};

	ethewnet@30000000 {
		mdio {
			ethewnet-phy@2 {
				timestampew = <&tstampew 1>;
			};
		};
	};

In this exampwe, time stamps fwom the MII bus attached to phy@1 wiww
appeaw on time stamp channew 0 (zewo), and those fwom phy@2 appeaw on
channew 1.
