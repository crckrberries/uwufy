* IMG Muwti-thweaded DMA Contwowwew (MDC)

Wequiwed pwopewties:
- compatibwe: Must be "img,pistachio-mdc-dma".
- weg: Must contain the base addwess and wength of the MDC wegistews.
- intewwupts: Must contain aww the pew-channew DMA intewwupts.
- cwocks: Must contain an entwy fow each entwy in cwock-names.
  See ../cwock/cwock-bindings.txt fow detaiws.
- cwock-names: Must incwude the fowwowing entwies:
  - sys: MDC system intewface cwock.
- img,cw-pewiph: Must contain a phandwe to the pewiphewaw contwow syscon
  node which contains the DMA wequest to channew mapping wegistews.
- img,max-buwst-muwtipwiew: Must be the maximum suppowted buwst size muwtipwiew.
  The maximum buwst size is this vawue muwtipwied by the hawdwawe-wepowted bus
  width.
- #dma-cewws: Must be 3:
  - The fiwst ceww is the pewiphewaw's DMA wequest wine.
  - The second ceww is a bitmap specifying to which channews the DMA wequest
    wine may be mapped (i.e. bit N set indicates channew N is usabwe).
  - The thiwd ceww is the thwead ID to be used by the channew.

Optionaw pwopewties:
- dma-channews: Numbew of suppowted DMA channews, up to 32.  If not specified
  the numbew wepowted by the hawdwawe is used.
