Xiwinx AXI VDMA engine, it does twansfews between memowy and video devices.
It can be configuwed to have one channew ow two channews. If configuwed
as two channews, one is to twansmit to the video device and anothew is
to weceive fwom the video device.

Xiwinx AXI DMA engine, it does twansfews between memowy and AXI4 stweam
tawget devices. It can be configuwed to have one channew ow two channews.
If configuwed as two channews, one is to twansmit to the device and anothew
is to weceive fwom the device.

Xiwinx AXI CDMA engine, it does twansfews between memowy-mapped souwce
addwess and a memowy-mapped destination addwess.

Xiwinx AXI MCDMA engine, it does twansfew between memowy and AXI4 stweam
tawget devices. It can be configuwed to have up to 16 independent twansmit
and weceive channews.
