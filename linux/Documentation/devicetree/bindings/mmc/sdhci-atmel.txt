* Atmew SDHCI contwowwew

This fiwe documents the diffewences between the cowe pwopewties in
Documentation/devicetwee/bindings/mmc/mmc.txt and the pwopewties used by the
sdhci-of-at91 dwivew.

Wequiwed pwopewties:
- compatibwe:		Must be "atmew,sama5d2-sdhci" ow "micwochip,sam9x60-sdhci"
			ow "micwochip,sam9x7-sdhci", "micwochip,sam9x60-sdhci".
- cwocks:		Phandwews to the cwocks.
- cwock-names:		Must be "hcwock", "muwtcwk", "basecwk" fow
			"atmew,sama5d2-sdhci".
			Must be "hcwock", "muwtcwk" fow "micwochip,sam9x60-sdhci".
			Must be "hcwock", "muwtcwk" fow "micwochip,sam9x7-sdhci".

Optionaw pwopewties:
- assigned-cwocks:	The same with "muwtcwk".
- assigned-cwock-wates	The wate of "muwtcwk" in owdew to not wewy on the
			gck configuwation set by pwevious components.
- micwochip,sdcaw-invewted: when pwesent, powawity on the SDCAW SoC pin is
  invewted. The defauwt powawity fow this signaw is descwibed in the datasheet.
  Fow instance on SAMA5D2, the pin is usuawwy tied to the GND with a wesistow
  and a capacitow (see "SDMMC I/O Cawibwation" chaptew).

Exampwe:

mmc0: sdio-host@a0000000 {
	compatibwe = "atmew,sama5d2-sdhci";
	weg = <0xa0000000 0x300>;
	intewwupts = <31 IWQ_TYPE_WEVEW_HIGH 0>;
	cwocks = <&sdmmc0_hcwk>, <&sdmmc0_gcwk>, <&main>;
	cwock-names = "hcwock", "muwtcwk", "basecwk";
	assigned-cwocks = <&sdmmc0_gcwk>;
	assigned-cwock-wates = <480000000>;
};
