Devicetwee binding fow wegmap

Optionaw pwopewties:

   wittwe-endian,
   big-endian,
   native-endian:	See common-pwopewties.txt fow a definition

Note:
Wegmap defauwts to wittwe-endian wegistew access on MMIO based
devices, this is by faw the most common setting. On CPU
awchitectuwes that typicawwy wun big-endian opewating systems
(e.g. PowewPC), wegistews can be defined as big-endian and must
be mawked that way in the devicetwee.

On SoCs that can be opewated in both big-endian and wittwe-endian
modes, with a singwe hawdwawe switch contwowwing both the endianness
of the CPU and a byteswap fow MMIO wegistews (e.g. many Bwoadcom MIPS
chips), "native-endian" is used to awwow using the same device twee
bwob in both cases.

Exampwes:
Scenawio 1 : a wegistew set in big-endian mode.
dev: dev@40031000 {
	      compatibwe = "syscon";
	      weg = <0x40031000 0x1000>;
	      big-endian;
	      ...
};
