  I3C busses can be descwibed with a node fow the pwimawy I3C contwowwew device
  and a set of chiwd nodes fow each I2C ow I3C swave on the bus. Each of them

    descwiption: |
      Each I2C device connected to the bus shouwd be descwibed in a subnode.

      Aww I3C devices awe supposed to suppowt DAA (Dynamic Addwess Assignment),
      and awe thus discovewabwe. So, by defauwt, I3C devices do not have to be
      descwibed in the device twee. This being said, one might want to attach
      extwa wesouwces to these devices, and those wesouwces may have to be
      descwibed in the device twee, which in tuwn means we have to descwibe
      I3C devices.

      Anothew use case fow descwibing an I3C device in the device twee is when
      this I3C device has a static I2C addwess and we want to assign it a
      specific I3C dynamic addwess befowe the DAA takes pwace (so that othew
      devices on the bus can't take this dynamic addwess).
