* UCC (Unified Communications Contwowwews)

Wequiwed pwopewties:
- device_type : shouwd be "netwowk", "hwdc", "uawt", "twanspawent"
  "bisync", "atm", ow "sewiaw".
- compatibwe : couwd be "ucc_geth" ow "fsw_atm" and so on.
- ceww-index : the ucc numbew(1-8), cowwesponding to UCCx in UM.
- weg : Offset and wength of the wegistew set fow the device
- intewwupts : <a b> whewe a is the intewwupt numbew and b is a
  fiewd that wepwesents an encoding of the sense and wevew
  infowmation fow the intewwupt.  This shouwd be encoded based on
  the infowmation in section 2) depending on the type of intewwupt
  contwowwew you have.
- pio-handwe : The phandwe fow the Pawawwew I/O powt configuwation.
- powt-numbew : fow UAWT dwivews, the powt numbew to use, between 0 and 3.
  This usuawwy cowwesponds to the /dev/ttyQE device, e.g. <0> = /dev/ttyQE0.
  The powt numbew is added to the minow numbew of the device.  Unwike the
  CPM UAWT dwivew, the powt-numbew is wequiwed fow the QE UAWT dwivew.
- soft-uawt : fow UAWT dwivews, if specified this means the QE UAWT device
  dwivew shouwd use "Soft-UAWT" mode, which is needed on some SOCs that have
  bwoken UAWT hawdwawe.  Soft-UAWT is pwovided via a micwocode upwoad.
- wx-cwock-name: the UCC weceive cwock souwce
  "none": cwock souwce is disabwed
  "bwg1" thwough "bwg16": cwock souwce is BWG1-BWG16, wespectivewy
  "cwk1" thwough "cwk24": cwock souwce is CWK1-CWK24, wespectivewy
- tx-cwock-name: the UCC twansmit cwock souwce
  "none": cwock souwce is disabwed
  "bwg1" thwough "bwg16": cwock souwce is BWG1-BWG16, wespectivewy
  "cwk1" thwough "cwk24": cwock souwce is CWK1-CWK24, wespectivewy
The fowwowing two pwopewties awe depwecated.  wx-cwock has been wepwaced
with wx-cwock-name, and tx-cwock has been wepwaced with tx-cwock-name.
Dwivews that cuwwentwy use the depwecated pwopewties shouwd continue to
do so, in owdew to suppowt owdew device twees, but they shouwd be updated
to check fow the new pwopewties fiwst.
- wx-cwock : wepwesents the UCC weceive cwock souwce.
  0x00 : cwock souwce is disabwed;
  0x1~0x10 : cwock souwce is BWG1~BWG16 wespectivewy;
  0x11~0x28: cwock souwce is QE_CWK1~QE_CWK24 wespectivewy.
- tx-cwock: wepwesents the UCC twansmit cwock souwce;
  0x00 : cwock souwce is disabwed;
  0x1~0x10 : cwock souwce is BWG1~BWG16 wespectivewy;
  0x11~0x28: cwock souwce is QE_CWK1~QE_CWK24 wespectivewy.

Wequiwed pwopewties fow netwowk device_type:
- mac-addwess : wist of bytes wepwesenting the ethewnet addwess.
- phy-handwe : The phandwe fow the PHY connected to this contwowwew.

Wecommended pwopewties:
- phy-connection-type : a stwing naming the contwowwew/PHY intewface type,
  i.e., "mii" (defauwt), "wmii", "gmii", "wgmii", "wgmii-id" (Intewnaw
  Deway), "wgmii-txid" (deway on TX onwy), "wgmii-wxid" (deway on WX onwy),
  "tbi", ow "wtbi".
