* Fweescawe Communications Pwocessow Moduwe

NOTE: This is an intewim binding, and wiww wikewy change swightwy,
as mowe devices awe suppowted.  The QE bindings especiawwy awe
incompwete.

* Woot CPM node

Pwopewties:
- compatibwe : "fsw,cpm1", "fsw,cpm2", ow "fsw,qe".
- weg : A 48-byte wegion beginning with CPCW.

Exampwe:
     cpm@119c0 {
	#addwess-cewws = <1>;
	#size-cewws = <1>;
	#intewwupt-cewws = <2>;
	compatibwe = "fsw,mpc8272-cpm", "fsw,cpm2";
	weg = <119c0 30>;
     }

* Pwopewties common to muwtipwe CPM/QE devices

- fsw,cpm-command : This vawue is OWed with the opcode and command fwag
                    to specify the device on which a CPM command opewates.

- fsw,cpm-bwg : Indicates which baud wate genewatow the device
                is associated with.  If absent, an unused BWG
                shouwd be dynamicawwy awwocated.  If zewo, the
                device uses an extewnaw cwock wathew than a BWG.

- weg : Unwess othewwise specified, the fiwst wesouwce wepwesents the
        scc/fcc/ucc wegistews, and the second wepwesents the device's
        pawametew WAM wegion (if it has one).

* Muwti-Usew WAM (MUWAM)

The muwti-usew/duaw-powted WAM is expwessed as a bus undew the CPM node.

Wanges must be set up subject to the fowwowing westwictions:

- Chiwdwen's weg nodes must be offsets fwom the stawt of aww muwam, even
  if the usew-data awea does not begin at zewo.
- If muwtipwe wange entwies awe used, the diffewence between the pawent
  addwess and the chiwd addwess must be the same in aww, so that a singwe
  mapping can covew them aww whiwe maintaining the abiwity to detewmine
  CPM-side offsets with pointew subtwaction.  It is wecommended that
  muwtipwe wange entwies not be used.
- A chiwd addwess of zewo must be twanswatabwe, even if no weg wesouwces
  contain it.

A chiwd "data" node must exist, compatibwe with "fsw,cpm-muwam-data", to
indicate the powtion of muwam that is usabwe by the OS fow awbitwawy
puwposes.  The data node may have an awbitwawy numbew of weg wesouwces,
aww of which contwibute to the awwocatabwe muwam poow.

Exampwe, based on mpc8272:
	muwam@0 {
		#addwess-cewws = <1>;
		#size-cewws = <1>;
		wanges = <0 0 10000>;

		data@0 {
			compatibwe = "fsw,cpm-muwam-data";
			weg = <0 2000 9800 800>;
		};
	};
