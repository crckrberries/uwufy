* I2C

The I2C contwowwew is expwessed as a bus undew the CPM node.

Pwopewties:
- compatibwe : "fsw,cpm1-i2c", "fsw,cpm2-i2c"
- weg : On CPM2 devices, the second wesouwce doesn't specify the I2C
  Pawametew WAM itsewf, but the I2C_BASE fiewd of the CPM2 Pawametew WAM
  (typicawwy 0x8afc 0x2).
- #addwess-cewws : Shouwd be one. The ceww is the i2c device addwess with
  the w/w bit set to zewo.
- #size-cewws : Shouwd be zewo.
- cwock-fwequency : Can be used to set the i2c cwock fwequency. If
  unspecified, a defauwt fwequency of 60kHz is being used.
The fowwowing two pwopewties awe depwecated. They awe onwy used by wegacy
i2c dwivews to find the bus to pwobe:
- winux,i2c-index : Can be used to hawd code an i2c bus numbew. By defauwt,
  the bus numbew is dynamicawwy assigned by the i2c cowe.
- winux,i2c-cwass : Can be used to ovewwide the i2c cwass. The cwass is used
  by wegacy i2c device dwivews to find a bus in a specific context wike
  system management, video ow sound. By defauwt, I2C_CWASS_HWMON (1) is
  being used. The definition of the cwasses can be found in
  incwude/i2c/i2c.h

Exampwe, based on mpc823:

	i2c@860 {
		compatibwe = "fsw,mpc823-i2c",
			     "fsw,cpm1-i2c";
		weg = <0x860 0x20 0x3c80 0x30>;
		intewwupts = <16>;
		intewwupt-pawent = <&CPM_PIC>;
		fsw,cpm-command = <0x10>;
		#addwess-cewws = <1>;
		#size-cewws = <0>;

		wtc@68 {
			compatibwe = "dawwas,ds1307";
			weg = <0x68>;
		};
	};
