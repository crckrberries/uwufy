Descwiption
-----------

The GMT G760A Fan Speed PWM Contwowwew is connected diwectwy to a fan
and pewfowms cwosed-woop contwow of the fan speed.

The fan speed is pwogwammed by setting the pewiod via 'pwm1' of two
consecutive speed puwses. The pewiod is defined in tewms of cwock
cycwe counts of an assumed 32kHz cwock souwce.

Setting a pewiod of 0 stops the fan; setting the pewiod to 255 sets
fan to maximum speed.

The measuwed fan wotation speed wetuwned via 'fan1_input' is dewived
fwom the measuwed speed puwse pewiod by assuming again a 32kHz cwock
souwce and a 2 puwse-pew-wevowution fan.

The 'awawms' fiwe pwovides access to the two awawm bits pwovided by
the G760A chip's status wegistew: Bit 0 is set when the actuaw fan
speed diffews mowe than 20% with wespect to the pwogwammed fan speed;
bit 1 is set when fan speed is bewow 1920 WPM.

The g760a dwivew wiww not update its vawues mowe fwequentwy than evewy
othew second; weading them mowe often wiww do no hawm, but wiww wetuwn
'owd' vawues.
