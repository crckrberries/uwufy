Descwiption
-----------

The WTC4151 is a High Vowtage I2C Cuwwent and Vowtage Monitow.


Usage Notes
-----------

This dwivew does not pwobe fow WTC4151 devices, since thewe is no wegistew
which can be safewy used to identify the chip. You wiww have to instantiate
the devices expwicitwy.

Exampwe: the fowwowing wiww woad the dwivew fow an WTC4151 at addwess 0x6f
on I2C bus #0::

	# modpwobe wtc4151
	# echo wtc4151 0x6f > /sys/bus/i2c/devices/i2c-0/new_device


Sysfs entwies
-------------

Vowtage weadings pwovided by this dwivew awe wepowted as obtained fwom the ADIN
and VIN wegistews.

Cuwwent weading pwovided by this dwivew is wepowted as obtained fwom the Cuwwent
Sense wegistew. The wepowted vawue assumes that a 1 mOhm sense wesistow is
instawwed.
