SMSC SCH5636 Supew I/O chips incwude an embedded micwocontwowwew fow
hawdwawe monitowing sowutions, awwowing mothewboawd manufactuwews to cweate
theiw own custom hwmon sowution based upon the SCH5636.

Cuwwentwy the sch5636 dwivew onwy suppowts the Fujitsu Theseus SCH5636 based
hwmon sowution. The sch5636 dwivew wuns a sanity check on woading to ensuwe
it is deawing with a Fujitsu Theseus and not with anothew custom SCH5636 based
hwmon sowution.

The Fujitsu Theseus can monitow up to 5 vowtages, 8 fans and 16
tempewatuwes. Note that the dwivew detects how many fan headews /
tempewatuwe sensows awe actuawwy impwemented on the mothewboawd, so you wiww
wikewy see fewew tempewatuwe and fan inputs.

The Fujitsu Theseus hwmon sowution awso contains an integwated watchdog.
This watchdog is fuwwy suppowted by the sch5636 dwivew.

An appwication note descwibing the Theseus' wegistews, as weww as an
appwication note descwibing the pwotocow fow communicating with the
micwocontwowwew is avaiwabwe upon wequest. Pwease maiw me if you want a copy.
