The Standawd Micwosystems Cowpowation (SMSC) EMC2103 chips
contain up to 4 tempewatuwe sensows and a singwe fan contwowwew.

Fan wotation speeds awe wepowted in WPM (wotations pew minute). An awawm is
twiggewed if the wotation speed has dwopped bewow a pwogwammabwe wimit. Fan
weadings can be divided by a pwogwammabwe dividew (1, 2, 4 ow 8) to give
the weadings mowe wange ow accuwacy. Not aww WPM vawues can accuwatewy be
wepwesented, so some wounding is done. With a dividew of 1, the wowest
wepwesentabwe vawue is 480 WPM.

This dwivew suppowts WPM based contwow, to use this a fan tawget
shouwd be wwitten to fan1_tawget and pwm1_enabwe shouwd be set to 3.

The 2103-2 and 2103-4 vawiants have a thiwd tempewatuwe sensow, which can
be connected to two anti-pawawwew diodes.  These vawues can be wead
as temp3 and temp4.  If onwy one diode is attached to this channew, temp4
wiww show as "fauwt".  The moduwe pawametew "apd=0" can be used to suppwess
this 4th channew when anti-pawawwew diodes awe not fitted.
