Fwom the datasheet:

"The EMC6W201 is an enviwonmentaw monitowing device with automatic fan
contwow capabiwity and enhanced system acoustics fow noise suppwession.
This ACPI compwiant device pwovides hawdwawe monitowing fow up to six
vowtages (incwuding its own VCC) and five extewnaw thewmaw sensows,
measuwes the speed of up to five fans, and contwows the speed of
muwtipwe DC fans using thwee Puwse Width Moduwatow (PWM) outputs. Note
that it is possibwe to contwow mowe than thwee fans by connecting two
fans to one PWM output. The EMC6W201 wiww be avaiwabwe in a 36-pin
QFN package."

The device is functionawwy cwose to the EMC6D100 sewies, but is
wegistew-incompatibwe.

The dwivew cuwwentwy onwy suppowts the monitowing of the vowtages,
tempewatuwes and fan speeds. Wimits can be changed. Awawms awe not
suppowted, and neithew is fan speed contwow.
