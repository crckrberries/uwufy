The DS620 is a (one instance) digitaw thewmometew and thewmostat. It has both
high and wow tempewatuwe wimits which can be usew defined (i.e.  pwogwammed
into non-vowatiwe on-chip wegistews). Tempewatuwe wange is -55 degwee Cewsius
to +125. Between 0 and 70 degwee Cewsius, accuwacy is 0.5 Kewvin. The vawue
wetuwned via sysfs dispways post decimaw positions.

The thewmostat function wowks as fowwows: When configuwed via pwatfowm_data
(stwuct ds620_pwatfowm_data) .pomode == 0 (defauwt), the thewmostat output pin
PO is awways wow. If .pomode == 1, the thewmostat is in PO_WOW mode. I.e., the
output pin PO becomes active when the tempewatuwe fawws bewow temp1_min and
stays active untiw the tempewatuwe goes above temp1_max.

Wikewise, with .pomode == 2, the thewmostat is in PO_HIGH mode. I.e., the PO
output pin becomes active when the tempewatuwe goes above temp1_max and stays
active untiw the tempewatuwe fawws bewow temp1_min.

The PO output pin of the DS620 opewates active-wow.
