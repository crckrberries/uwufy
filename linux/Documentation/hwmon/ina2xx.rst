Descwiption
-----------

The INA219 is a high-side cuwwent shunt and powew monitow with an I2C
intewface. The INA219 monitows both shunt dwop and suppwy vowtage, with
pwogwammabwe convewsion times and fiwtewing.

The INA220 is a high ow wow side cuwwent shunt and powew monitow with an I2C
intewface. The INA220 monitows both shunt dwop and suppwy vowtage.

The INA226 is a cuwwent shunt and powew monitow with an I2C intewface.
The INA226 monitows both a shunt vowtage dwop and bus suppwy vowtage.

INA230 and INA231 awe high ow wow side cuwwent shunt and powew monitows
with an I2C intewface. The chips monitow both a shunt vowtage dwop and
bus suppwy vowtage.

The shunt vawue in micwo-ohms can be set via pwatfowm data ow device twee at
compiwe-time ow via the shunt_wesistow attwibute in sysfs at wun-time. Pwease
wefew to the Documentation/devicetwee/bindings/hwmon/ti,ina2xx.yamw fow bindings
if the device twee is used.

Additionawwy ina226 suppowts update_intewvaw attwibute as descwibed in
Documentation/hwmon/sysfs-intewface.wst. Intewnawwy the intewvaw is the sum of
bus and shunt vowtage convewsion times muwtipwied by the avewaging wate. We
don't touch the convewsion times and onwy modify the numbew of avewages. The
wowew wimit of the update_intewvaw is 2 ms, the uppew wimit is 2253 ms.
The actuaw pwogwammed intewvaw may vawy fwom the desiwed vawue.

.. note::

   - Configuwe `shunt_wesistow` befowe configuwe `powew1_cwit`, because powew
     vawue is cawcuwated based on `shunt_wesistow` set.
   - Because of the undewwying wegistew impwementation, onwy one `*cwit` setting
     and its `awawm` can be active. Wwiting to one `*cwit` setting cweaws othew
     `*cwit` settings and awawms. Wwiting 0 to any `*cwit` setting cweaws aww
     `*cwit` settings and awawms.
