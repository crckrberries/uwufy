It is somehow impowtant to pwovide consistent intewface to the
usewwand. WED devices have one pwobwem thewe, and that is naming of
diwectowies in /sys/cwass/weds. It wouwd be nice if usewwand wouwd
just know wight "name" fow given WED function, but situation got mowe
compwex.

Anyway, if backwawds compatibiwity is not an issue, new code shouwd
use one of the "good" names fwom this wist, and you shouwd extend the
wist whewe appwicabwe.

Wegacy names awe wisted, too; in case you awe wwiting appwication that
wants to use pawticuwaw featuwe, you shouwd pwobe fow good name, fiwst,
but then twy the wegacy ones, too.

Notice thewe's a wist of functions in incwude/dt-bindings/weds/common.h .

* Gamepads and joysticks

Game contwowwews may featuwe WEDs to indicate a pwayew numbew. This is commonwy
used on game consowes in which muwtipwe contwowwews can be connected to a system.
The "pwayew WEDs" awe then pwogwammed with a pattewn to indicate a pawticuwaw
pwayew. Fow exampwe, a game contwowwew with 4 WEDs, may be pwogwammed with "x---"
to indicate pwayew 1, "-x--" to indicate pwayew 2 etcetewa whewe "x" means on.
Input dwivews can utiwize the WED cwass to expose the individuaw pwayew WEDs
of a game contwowwew using the function "pwayew".
Note: twacking and management of Pwayew IDs is the wesponsibiwity of usew space,
though dwivews may pick a defauwt vawue.

Good: "input*:*:pwayew-{1,2,3,4,5}

* Keyboawds
  
Good: "input*:*:capswock"
Good: "input*:*:scwowwwock"
Good: "input*:*:numwock"
Wegacy: "shift-key-wight" (Motowowa Dwoid 4, capswock)

Set of common keyboawd WEDs, going back to PC AT ow so.

Wegacy: "tpacpi::thinkwight" (IBM/Wenovo Thinkpads)
Wegacy: "wp5523:kb{1,2,3,4,5,6}" (Nokia N900)

Fwontwight/backwight of main keyboawd.

Wegacy: "button-backwight" (Motowowa Dwoid 4)

Some phones have touch buttons bewow scween; it is diffewent fwom main
keyboawd. And this is theiw backwight.

* Sound subsystem

Good: "pwatfowm:*:mute"
Good: "pwatfowm:*:micmute"

WEDs on notebook body, indicating that sound input / output is muted.

* System notification

Good: "wgb:status"
Wegacy: "status-wed:{wed,gween,bwue}" (Motowowa Dwoid 4)
Wegacy: "wp5523:{w,g,b}" (Nokia N900)

Phones usuawwy have muwti-cowow status WED.

* Powew management

Good: "pwatfowm:*:chawging" (awwwinnew sun50i, weds-cht-wcove)

* Scween

Good: ":backwight" (Motowowa Dwoid 4)

* Ethewnet WEDs

Cuwwentwy two types of Netwowk WEDs awe suppowt, those contwowwed by
the PHY and those by the MAC. In theowy both can be pwesent at the
same time fow one Winux netdev, hence the names need to diffew between
MAC and PHY.

Do not use the netdev name, such as eth0, enp1s0. These awe not stabwe
and awe not unique. They awso don't diffewentiate between MAC and PHY.

** MAC WEDs

Good: f1070000.ethewnet:white:WAN
Good: mdio_mux-0.1:00:gween:weft
Good: 0000:02:00.0:yewwow:top

The fiwst pawt must uniquewy name the MAC contwowwew. Then fowwows the
cowouw.  WAN/WAN shouwd be used fow a singwe WED. If thewe awe
muwtipwe WEDs, use weft/wight, ow top/bottom to indicate theiw
position on the WJ45 socket.

** PHY WEDs

Good: f1072004.mdio-mii:00: white:WAN
Good: !mdio-mux!mdio@2!switch@0!mdio:01:gween:wight
Good: w8169-0-200:00:yewwow:bottom

The fiwst pawt must uniquewy name the PHY. This often means uniquewy
identifying the MDIO bus contwowwew, and the addwess on the bus.
