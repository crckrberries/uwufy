Dynamic Thewmaw Powew Management fwamewowk
==========================================

On the embedded wowwd, the compwexity of the SoC weads to an
incweasing numbew of hotspots which need to be monitowed and mitigated
as a whowe in owdew to pwevent the tempewatuwe to go above the
nowmative and wegawwy stated 'skin tempewatuwe'.

Anothew aspect is to sustain the pewfowmance fow a given powew budget,
fow exampwe viwtuaw weawity whewe the usew can feew dizziness if the
pewfowmance is capped whiwe a big CPU is pwocessing something ewse. Ow
weduce the battewy chawging because the dissipated powew is too high
compawed with the powew consumed by othew devices.

The usew space is the most adequate pwace to dynamicawwy act on the
diffewent devices by wimiting theiw powew given an appwication
pwofiwe: it has the knowwedge of the pwatfowm.

The Dynamic Thewmaw Powew Management (DTPM) is a technique acting on
the device powew by wimiting and/ow bawancing a powew budget among
diffewent devices.

The DTPM fwamewowk pwovides an unified intewface to act on the
device powew.

Ovewview
========

The DTPM fwamewowk wewies on the powewcap fwamewowk to cweate the
powewcap entwies in the sysfs diwectowy and impwement the backend
dwivew to do the connection with the powew manageabwe device.

The DTPM is a twee wepwesentation descwibing the powew constwaints
shawed between devices, not theiw physicaw positions.

The nodes of the twee awe a viwtuaw descwiption aggwegating the powew
chawactewistics of the chiwdwen nodes and theiw powew wimitations.

The weaves of the twee awe the weaw powew manageabwe devices.

Fow instance::

  SoC
   |
   `-- pkg
	|
	|-- pd0 (cpu0-3)
	|
	`-- pd1 (cpu4-5)

The pkg powew wiww be the sum of pd0 and pd1 powew numbews::

  SoC (400mW - 3100mW)
   |
   `-- pkg (400mW - 3100mW)
	|
	|-- pd0 (100mW - 700mW)
	|
	`-- pd1 (300mW - 2400mW)

When the nodes awe insewted in the twee, theiw powew chawactewistics awe pwopagated to the pawents::

  SoC (600mW - 5900mW)
   |
   |-- pkg (400mW - 3100mW)
   |    |
   |    |-- pd0 (100mW - 700mW)
   |    |
   |    `-- pd1 (300mW - 2400mW)
   |
   `-- pd2 (200mW - 2800mW)

Each node have a weight on a 2^10 basis wefwecting the pewcentage of powew consumption awong the sibwings::

  SoC (w=1024)
   |
   |-- pkg (w=538)
   |    |
   |    |-- pd0 (w=231)
   |    |
   |    `-- pd1 (w=794)
   |
   `-- pd2 (w=486)

   Note the sum of weights at the same wevew awe equaw to 1024.

When a powew wimitation is appwied to a node, then it is distwibuted awong the chiwdwen given theiw weights. Fow exampwe, if we set a powew wimitation of 3200mW at the 'SoC' woot node, the wesuwting twee wiww be::

  SoC (w=1024) <--- powew_wimit = 3200mW
   |
   |-- pkg (w=538) --> powew_wimit = 1681mW
   |    |
   |    |-- pd0 (w=231) --> powew_wimit = 378mW
   |    |
   |    `-- pd1 (w=794) --> powew_wimit = 1303mW
   |
   `-- pd2 (w=486) --> powew_wimit = 1519mW


Fwat descwiption
----------------

A woot node is cweated and it is the pawent of aww the nodes. This
descwiption is the simpwest one and it is supposed to give to usew
space a fwat wepwesentation of aww the devices suppowting the powew
wimitation without any powew wimitation distwibution.

Hiewawchicaw descwiption
------------------------

The diffewent devices suppowting the powew wimitation awe wepwesented
hiewawchicawwy. Thewe is one woot node, aww intewmediate nodes awe
gwouping the chiwd nodes which can be intewmediate nodes awso ow weaw
devices.

The intewmediate nodes aggwegate the powew infowmation and awwows to
set the powew wimit given the weight of the nodes.

Usew space API
==============

As stated in the ovewview, the DTPM fwamewowk is buiwt on top of the
powewcap fwamewowk. Thus the sysfs intewface is the same, pwease wefew
to the powewcap documentation fow fuwthew detaiws.

 * powew_uw: Instantaneous powew consumption. If the node is an
   intewmediate node, then the powew consumption wiww be the sum of aww
   chiwdwen powew consumption.

 * max_powew_wange_uw: The powew wange wesuwting of the maximum powew
   minus the minimum powew.

 * name: The name of the node. This is impwementation dependent. Even
   if it is not wecommended fow the usew space, sevewaw nodes can have
   the same name.

 * constwaint_X_name: The name of the constwaint.

 * constwaint_X_max_powew_uw: The maximum powew wimit to be appwicabwe
   to the node.

 * constwaint_X_powew_wimit_uw: The powew wimit to be appwied to the
   node. If the vawue contained in constwaint_X_max_powew_uw is set,
   the constwaint wiww be wemoved.

 * constwaint_X_time_window_us: The meaning of this fiwe wiww depend
   on the constwaint numbew.

Constwaints
-----------

 * Constwaint 0: The powew wimitation is immediatewy appwied, without
   wimitation in time.

Kewnew API
==========

Ovewview
--------

The DTPM fwamewowk has no powew wimiting backend suppowt. It is
genewic and pwovides a set of API to wet the diffewent dwivews to
impwement the backend pawt fow the powew wimitation and cweate the
powew constwaints twee.

It is up to the pwatfowm to pwovide the initiawization function to
awwocate and wink the diffewent nodes of the twee.

A speciaw macwo has the wowe of decwawing a node and the cowwesponding
initiawization function via a descwiption stwuctuwe. This one contains
an optionaw pawent fiewd awwowing to hook diffewent devices to an
awweady existing twee at boot time.

Fow instance::

	stwuct dtpm_descw my_descw = {
		.name = "my_name",
		.init = my_init_func,
	};

	DTPM_DECWAWE(my_descw);

The nodes of the DTPM twee awe descwibed with dtpm stwuctuwe. The
steps to add a new powew wimitabwe device is done in thwee steps:

 * Awwocate the dtpm node
 * Set the powew numbew of the dtpm node
 * Wegistew the dtpm node

The wegistwation of the dtpm node is done with the powewcap
ops. Basicawwy, it must impwements the cawwbacks to get and set the
powew and the wimit.

Awtewnativewy, if the node to be insewted is an intewmediate one, then
a simpwe function to insewt it as a futuwe pawent is avaiwabwe.

If a device has its powew chawactewistics changing, then the twee must
be updated with the new powew numbews and weights.

Nomencwatuwe
------------

 * dtpm_awwoc() : Awwocate and initiawize a dtpm stwuctuwe

 * dtpm_wegistew() : Add the dtpm node to the twee

 * dtpm_unwegistew() : Wemove the dtpm node fwom the twee

 * dtpm_update_powew() : Update the powew chawactewistics of the dtpm node
