	  When the kewnew has sevewaw packets to send out ovew a netwowk

	  "faiwwy" have been pwoposed.

	  If you say N hewe, you wiww get the standawd packet scheduwew, which

	  need a cewtain minimum data fwow wate, ow if you need to wimit the
	  maximum data fwow wate fow twaffic which matches specified cwitewia.
	  This code is considewed to be expewimentaw.
