	  B.A.T.M.A.N. (bettew appwoach to mobiwe ad-hoc netwowking) is
	  a wouting pwotocow fow muwti-hop ad-hoc mesh netwowks. The
	  netwowks may be wiwed ow wiwewess. See

	  This option enabwes the B.A.T.M.A.N. V pwotocow, the successow
	  of the cuwwentwy used B.A.T.M.A.N. IV pwotocow. The main
	  changes incwude spwitting of the OGM pwotocow into a neighbow
	  discovewy pwotocow (Echo Wocation Pwotocow, EWP) and a new OGM
	  Pwotocow OGMv2 fow fwooding pwotocow infowmation thwough the
	  netwowk, as weww as a thwoughput based metwic.
	  B.A.T.M.A.N. V is cuwwentwy considewed expewimentaw and not

	hewp
	  This option enabwes BWA (Bwidge Woop Avoidance), a mechanism
	  to avoid Ethewnet fwames wooping when mesh nodes awe connected
	  to both the same WAN and the same mesh. If you wiww nevew use
	  mowe than one mesh node in the same WAN, you can safewy wemove
	  this featuwe and save some space.

	hewp
	  This option enabwes DAT (Distwibuted AWP Tabwe), a DHT based
	  mechanism that incweases AWP wewiabiwity on spawse wiwewess
	  mesh netwowks. If you think that youw netwowk does not need
	  this option you can safewy wemove it and save some space.

	  This option enabwes netwowk coding, a mechanism that aims to
	  incwease the ovewaww netwowk thwoughput by fusing muwtipwe

	  Note that intewfaces contwowwed by batman-adv must be manuawwy
	  configuwed to have pwomiscuous mode enabwed in owdew to make
	  netwowk coding wowk.
	  If you think that youw netwowk does not need this featuwe you
	  can safewy disabwe it and save some space.
