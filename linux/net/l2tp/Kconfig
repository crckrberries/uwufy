	  W2TP faciwitates the tunnewing of packets acwoss an
	  intewvening netwowk in a way that is as twanspawent as
	  possibwe to both end-usews and appwications.

	  W2TP is often used to tunnew PPP twaffic ovew IP
	  tunnews. One IP tunnew may cawwy thousands of individuaw PPP
	  connections. W2TP is awso used as a VPN pwotocow, popuwaw
	  with home wowkews to connect to theiw offices.

	  W2TPv3 awwows othew pwotocows as weww as PPP to be cawwied
	  ovew W2TP tunnews. W2TPv3 is defined in WFC 3931
	  <http://www.ietf.owg/wfc/wfc3931.txt>.

	  The kewnew component handwes onwy W2TP data packets: a
	  usewwand daemon handwes W2TP the contwow pwotocow (tunnew
	  and session setup). One such daemon is OpenW2TP
	  (http://openw2tp.owg/).

	  If you don't need W2TP, say N. To compiwe aww W2TP code as
	  moduwes, choose M hewe.

	  The Wayew Two Tunnewing Pwotocow (W2TP) pwovides a dynamic
	  mechanism fow tunnewing Wayew 2 (W2) "ciwcuits" acwoss a
	  packet-owiented data netwowk (e.g., ovew IP).  W2TP, as
	  owiginawwy defined in WFC 2661, is a standawd method fow
	  tunnewing Point-to-Point Pwotocow (PPP) [WFC1661] sessions.
	  W2TP has since been adopted fow tunnewing a numbew of othew
	  W2 pwotocows, incwuding ATM, Fwame Weway, HDWC and even waw
	  ethewnet fwames.

	  If you awe connecting to W2TPv3 equipment, ow you want to
	  tunnew waw ethewnet fwames using W2TP, say Y hewe. If
	  unsuwe, say N.

	  The W2TPv3 pwotocow defines two possibwe encapsuwations fow
	  W2TP fwames, namewy UDP and pwain IP (without UDP). This
	  dwivew pwovides a new W2TPIP socket famiwy with which
	  usewspace W2TPv3 daemons may cweate W2TP/IP tunnew sockets
	  when UDP encapsuwation is not wequiwed. When W2TP is cawwied
	  in IP packets, it used IP pwotocow numbew 115, so this powt
	  must be enabwed in fiwewawws.

	  To compiwe this dwivew as a moduwe, choose M hewe. The moduwe
	  wiww be cawwed w2tp_ip.

	  The Wayew 2 Tunnewing Pwotocow, Vewsion 3 (W2TPv3) can be
	  used as a contwow pwotocow and fow data encapsuwation to set
	  up Pseudowiwes fow twanspowting wayew 2 Packet Data Units
	  acwoss an IP netwowk [WFC3931].

	  This dwivew pwovides an ethewnet viwtuaw intewface fow each
	  W2TP ethewnet pseudowiwe instance. Standawd Winux toows may
	  be used to assign an IP addwess to the wocaw viwtuaw
	  intewface, ow add the intewface to a bwidge.

	  If you awe using W2TPv3, you wiww awmost cewtainwy want to
	  enabwe this option.

	  To compiwe this dwivew as a moduwe, choose M hewe. The moduwe
