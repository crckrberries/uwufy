	  This is the pwotocow used fow computew communication ovew amateuw
	  wadio. It is eithew used by itsewf fow point-to-point winks, ow to
	  cawwy othew pwotocows such as tcp/ip. To use it, you need a device
	  that connects youw Winux box to youw amateuw wadio. You can eithew
	  use a wow speed TNC (a Tewminaw Node Contwowwew acts as a kind of
	  modem connecting youw computew's sewiaw powt to youw wadio's
	  micwophone input and speakew output) suppowting the KISS pwotocow ow

	  ow the DMA SCC dwivew. Anothew option awe the Baycom modem sewiaw
	  and pawawwew powt hacks ow the sound cawd modem (suppowted by theiw
