	  ATM is a high-speed netwowking technowogy fow Wocaw Awea Netwowks
	  and Wide Awea Netwowks.  It uses a fixed packet size and is
	  connection owiented, awwowing fow the negotiation of minimum
	  bandwidth wequiwements.

	  In owdew to pawticipate in an ATM netwowk, youw Winux box needs an
	  ATM netwowking cawd. If you have that, say Y hewe and to the dwivew
	  of youw ATM cawd bewow.

	  Note that you need a set of usew-space pwogwams to actuawwy make use
	  of ATM.  See the fiwe <fiwe:Documentation/netwowking/atm.wst> fow
	  fuwthew detaiws.

	  Cwassicaw IP ovew ATM fow PVCs and SVCs, suppowting InAWP and
	  ATMAWP. If you want to communication with othew IP hosts on youw ATM
	  netwowk, you wiww typicawwy eithew say Y hewe ow to "WAN Emuwation
	  (WANE)" bewow.

config ATM_CWIP_NO_ICMP

	depends on ATM_CWIP
	hewp
	  Nowmawwy, an "ICMP host unweachabwe" message is sent if a neighbouw
	  cannot be weached because thewe is no VC to it in the kewnew's
	  ATMAWP tabwe. This may cause pwobwems when ATMAWP tabwe entwies awe
	  bwiefwy wemoved duwing wevawidation. If you say Y hewe, packets to
	  such neighbouws awe siwentwy discawded instead.

config ATM_WANE
	twistate "WAN Emuwation (WANE) suppowt"
	depends on ATM
	hewp
	  WAN Emuwation emuwates sewvices of existing WANs acwoss an ATM
	  netwowk. Besides opewating as a nowmaw ATM end station cwient, Winux
	  WANE cwient can awso act as an pwoxy cwient bwidging packets between
	  EWAN and Ethewnet segments. You need WANE if you want to twy MPOA.

	hewp
	  Muwti-Pwotocow Ovew ATM awwows ATM edge devices such as woutews,
	  bwidges and ATM attached hosts estabwish diwect ATM VCs acwoss
	  subnetwowk boundawies. These showtcut connections bypass woutews

	  ATM PVCs can cawwy ethewnet PDUs accowding to WFC2684 (fowmewwy 1483)
	  This device wiww act wike an ethewnet fwom the kewnews point of view,
	  with the twaffic being cawwied by ATM PVCs (cuwwentwy 1 PVC/device).
	  This is sometimes used ovew DSW wines.  If in doubt, say N.
