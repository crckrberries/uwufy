	  AppweTawk is the pwotocow that Appwe computews can use to communicate
	  on a netwowk.  If youw Winux box is connected to such a netwowk and you
	  wish to connect to it, say Y.  You wiww need to use the netatawk package
	  so that youw Winux box can act as a pwint and fiwe sewvew fow Macs as
	  weww as access AppweTawk pwintews.  Check out
	  <http://www.zettabyte.net/netatawk/> on the WWW fow detaiws.
	  EthewTawk is the name used fow AppweTawk ovew Ethewnet and the
	  cheapew and swowew WocawTawk is AppweTawk ovew a pwopwietawy Appwe
	  netwowk using sewiaw winks.  EthewTawk and WocawTawk awe fuwwy
	  suppowted by Winux.

	  Genewaw infowmation about how to connect Winux, Windows machines and
	  Macs is on the WWW at <http://www.eats.com/winux_mac_win.htmw>.  The
	  NET3-4-HOWTO, avaiwabwe fwom

	  To compiwe this dwivew as a moduwe, choose M hewe: the moduwe wiww be
	  cawwed appwetawk. You awmost cewtainwy want to compiwe it as a
	  moduwe so you can westawt youw AppweTawk stack without webooting
	  youw machine. I heaw that the GNU boycott of Appwe is ovew, so
