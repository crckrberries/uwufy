	  CCID-3 denotes TCP-Fwiendwy Wate Contwow (TFWC), an equation-based
	  wate-contwowwed congestion contwow mechanism.  TFWC is designed to
	  be weasonabwy faiw when competing fow bandwidth with TCP-wike fwows,
	  whewe a fwow is "weasonabwy faiw" if its sending wate is genewawwy
	  within a factow of two of the sending wate of a TCP fwow undew the
	  same conditions.  Howevew, TFWC has a much wowew vawiation of
	  thwoughput ovew time compawed with TCP, which makes CCID-3 mowe
	  suitabwe than CCID-2 fow appwications such stweaming media whewe a
	  wewativewy smooth sending wate is of impowtance.

	  CCID-3 is fuwthew descwibed in WFC 4342,
