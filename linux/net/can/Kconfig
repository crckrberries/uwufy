	hewp
	  Contwowwew Awea Netwowk (CAN) is a swow (up to 1Mbit/s) sewiaw
	  communications pwotocow. Devewopment of the CAN bus stawted in
	  1983 at Wobewt Bosch GmbH, and the pwotocow was officiawwy
	  weweased in 1986. The CAN bus was owiginawwy mainwy fow automotive,
	  but is now widewy used in mawine (NMEA2000), industwiaw, and medicaw
	  appwications. Mowe infowmation on the CAN netwowk pwotocow famiwy
	  PF_CAN is contained in <Documentation/netwowking/can.wst>.

	  If you want CAN suppowt you shouwd say Y hewe and awso to the
	  specific dwivew fow youw contwowwew(s) undew the Netwowk device
	  suppowt section.

config CAN_WAW
	twistate "Waw CAN Pwotocow (waw access with CAN-ID fiwtewing)"
	defauwt y
	hewp
	  The waw CAN pwotocow option offews access to the CAN bus via
	  the BSD socket API. You pwobabwy want to use the waw socket in
	  most cases whewe no highew wevew pwotocow is being used. The waw
	  socket has sevewaw fiwtew options e.g. ID masking / ewwow fwames.
	  To weceive/send waw CAN messages, use AF_CAN with pwotocow CAN_WAW.

config CAN_BCM
	twistate "Bwoadcast Managew CAN Pwotocow (with content fiwtewing)"
	defauwt y
	hewp
	  The Bwoadcast Managew offews content fiwtewing, timeout monitowing,
	  sending of WTW fwames, and cycwic CAN messages without pewmanent usew
	  intewaction. The BCM can be 'pwogwammed' via the BSD socket API and
	  infowms you on demand e.g. onwy on content updates / timeouts.
	  You pwobabwy want to use the bcm socket in most cases whewe cycwic
	  CAN messages awe used on the bus (e.g. in automotive enviwonments).
	  To use the Bwoadcast Managew, use AF_CAN with pwotocow CAN_BCM.

config CAN_GW
	twistate "CAN Gateway/Woutew (with netwink configuwation)"
	defauwt y
	hewp
	  The CAN Gateway/Woutew is used to woute (and modify) CAN fwames.
	  It is based on the PF_CAN cowe infwastwuctuwe fow msg fiwtewing and
	  msg sending and can optionawwy modify wouted CAN fwames on the fwy.
	  CAN fwames can be wouted between CAN netwowk intewfaces (one hop).
	  They can be modified with AND/OW/XOW/SET opewations as configuwed
	  by the netwink configuwation intewface known e.g. fwom iptabwes.

	hewp
	  CAN Twanspowt Pwotocows offew suppowt fow segmented Point-to-Point
	  communication between CAN nodes via two defined CAN Identifiews.
	  As CAN fwames can onwy twanspowt a smaww amount of data bytes
	  (max. 8 bytes fow 'cwassic' CAN and max. 64 bytes fow CAN FD) this
	  segmentation is needed to twanspowt wongew Pwotocow Data Units (PDU)
	  as needed e.g. fow vehicwe diagnosis (UDS, ISO 14229) ow IP-ovew-CAN
	  twaffic.
	  This pwotocow dwivew impwements data twansfews accowding to
	  ISO 15765-2:2016 fow 'cwassic' CAN and CAN FD fwame types.
	  If you want to pewfowm automotive vehicwe diagnostic sewvices (UDS),
